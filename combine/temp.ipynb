       "  'abstract': 'Successful control of emerging infectious diseases requires accelerated development of fast, affordable, and accessible assays for wide implementation at a high frequency. This paper presents a design for an in-solution assay pipeline, featuring nanobody-functionalized nanoparticles for rapid, electronic detection (Nano2RED) of Ebola and COVID-19 antigens. Synthetic nanobody binders with high affinity, specificity, and stability are selected from a combinatorial library and site-specifically conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Without requiring any fluorescent labelling, washing, or enzymatic amplification, these multivalent AuNP sensors reliably transduce antigen binding signals upon mixing into physical AuNP aggregation and sedimentation processes, displaying antigen-dependent optical extinction readily detectable by spectrometry or portable electronic circuitry. With Ebola virus secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as targets, Nano2RED showed a high sensitivity (the limit of detection of ∼10\\xa0pg /mL, or 0.13 pM for sGP and ∼40\\xa0pg/mL, or ∼1.3 pM for RBD in diluted human serum), a high specificity, a large dynamic range (∼7 logs),and fast readout within minutes. The rapid detection, low material cost (estimated <$0.01 per test), inexpensive and portable readout system (estimated <$5), and digital data output, make Nano2RED a particularly accessible assay in screening of patient samples towards successful control of infectious diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide. However, as soon as the first vaccines-the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far-were released, mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged, raising doubts about their efficiency. This study aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state, in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor, ACE2, rather than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, since the difference observed in the free energy values was small (although more attractive in general). Conversely, the South African/Beta variant (B.1.351), compared with the SARS-CoV-2 wild type (wt), is much more stable in the opened state with one or two RBDs in the up position than in the closed state with three RBDs in the down position favoring the infection. Such results contribute to understanding the natural history of disease and indicate possible strategies for developing new therapeutic molecules and adjusting the vaccine doses for higher B-cell antibody production.',\n",

This study describes the serostatus of the LTCF residents and monitors changes in their humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoV) over seven months.\\nA total of 132 serum samples were collected from all 106 consenting residents (aged 54-102) post-first outbreak (N=87) and post-second outbreak (N=45) in one LTCF; 26/106 participants provided their serum following both COVID-19 outbreaks, permitting longitudinal comparisons between surveys. Health-Canada approved commercial serologic tests and a pan-coronavirus multiplexed immunoassay were used to evaluate antibody levels against the spike protein, nucleocapsid, and receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the spike proteins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43.

Upon vaccination, all vaccinated individuals displayed a convergent antibody response with shared common antibody clones and public neutralizing antibodies.

However, this vaccine induces lower severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S)-specific antibody levels than those induced by messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines. The immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a homologous or heterologous booster in persons who have received an Ad26.COV2.S priming dose are unclear.\\nIn this single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving health care workers who had received a priming dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, we assessed immunogenicity and reactogenicity 28 days after a homologous or heterologous booster vaccination. The participants were assigned to receive no booster, an Ad26.COV2.S booster, an mRNA-1273 booster, or a BNT162b2 booster. The primary end point was the level of S-specific binding antibodies, and the secondary end points were the levels of neutralizing antibodies, S-specific T-cell responses, and reactogenicity. A post hoc analysis was performed to compare mRNA-1273 boosting with BNT162b2 boosting.\\nHomologous or heterologous booster vaccination in 434 participants resulted in higher levels of S-specific binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell responses than a single Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. The increase in binding antibodies was significantly larger with heterologous regimens that included mRNA-based vaccines than with the homologous booster. The mRNA-1273 booster was most immunogenic and was associated with higher reactogenicity than the BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S boosters. Local and systemic reactions were generally mild to moderate in the first 2 days after booster administration.\\nThe Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA boosters had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in health care workers who had received a priming dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. The strongest responses occurred after boosting with mRNA-based vaccines. Boosting with any available vaccine was better than not boosting.

To investigate the usefulness of a serological assay to predict vaccine efficacy, we analyzed the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals in Japan. This study included 219 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2. The levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against RBD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after the first and second vaccination, respectively. The relationship between antibody levels and several factors, including age, gender, and hypertension were analyzed. Virus-neutralizing activity in sera was measured to determine the correlation with the levels of antibodies. A chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method to measure IgG against RBD was developed and validated for the clinical setting. The levels of all antibody isotypes were increased after vaccination. Among them, RBD-IgG was dramatically increased after the second vaccination. The IgG levels in females were significantly higher than in males. There was a negative correlation between age and IgG levels in males. The IgG levels significantly correlated with the neutralizing activity. The CLEIA assay measuring IgG against RBD showed a reliable performance and a high correlation with neutralizing activity. Monitoring of IgG against RBD is a powerful tool to predict the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and provides useful information in considering a personalized vaccination strategy for COVID-19.

       "  'abstract': 'Background A single dose COVID-19 vaccines, mostly mRNA-based vaccines, are shown to induce robust antibody responses in individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the sufficiency of a single dose to those individuals. However, these important data are limited to developed nations and lacking in resource-limited countries, like Ethiopia. Methods We compared receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG antibodies in 40 SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants and 25 participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We measured the antibody response in post-vaccination blood samples from both groups of participants collected at four different post-vaccination time points: 8- and 12-weeks after each dose of the vaccine administration using an in-house developed ELISA. Results We observed a high level of anti-RBD IgG antibodies titers 8-weeks after a single dose administration (16/27; 59.3%) among naïve participants, albeit dropped significantly (p<0.05) two months later, suggesting the protective immunity elicited by the first dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine will likely last for a minimum of three months. However, as expected, a significant (p<0.001) increase in the level of anti-RBD IgG antibodies titers was observed after the second dose administration in all naïve participants. By contrast, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine-induced anti-RBD IgG antibody titers produced by the P.I participants at 8- to 12-weeks post-single dose vaccination were found to be similar to the antibody titers seen after a two-dose vaccination course among infection- naïve participants and showed no significant (p>0.05) increment following the second dose administration. Conclusion Taken together, our findings show that a single ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals elicits similar antibody responses to that of double dose vaccinated naïve individuals. Age and sex were not associated with the level of vaccine-elicited immune responses in both individuals with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to assess the need for a booster dose to extend the duration and amplitude of the specific protective immune response in Ethiopia settings, especially following the Omicron pandemic.',\n",

Despite the available treatments, this disease is not being controlled totally and spreading swiftly. The deadly virus commences infection by hACE2 receptor and its co-receptors (DPP4) engagement with the viral spike protein in the lung alveolar epithelial cells, indicating a primary therapeutic target. The current research attempts to design an in-silico Bispecific antibody (BsAb) against viral spike glycoprotein and DPP4 receptors. Regdanvimab and Begelomab were identified to block the D614G mutated spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and host DPP4 receptor, respectively. The designed BsAb was modified by using KIH (Knobs into Holes) and CrossMAb techniques to prevent heavy chain and light chain mispairings. Following the modifications, the site-specific molecular docking studies were performed, revealing a relatively higher binding affinity of BsAb with spike glycoprotein and DPP4 co-receptor than control BsAb. Also, for blocking the primary entry receptor, hACE2, an anti-viral peptide was linked to the Fc region of BsAb that blocks the hACE2 receptor by linker cleavage inside the infected host. Thus, the designed BsAb and anti-viral peptide therapy could be a promising triumvirate way to obstruct the viral entry by blocking the receptor engagement.',\n",

Many of these new mutations, especially those located in the receptor binding domain, are likely to improve binding to the ACE2 receptor and to avoid binding to antibodies induced by a previous infection or by vaccination. Today there are several different hypotheses about the origin of Omicron, for example that it would have arisen in an immunosuppressed individual. Alternatively, a SARS-CoV-2 variant could have infected an unknown animal, and re-infection of humans would then have occurred. Furthermore, Omicron may have picked up a piece of a human common cold coronavirus.\\xa0 The hitherto available data suggest that the rapid spread of Omicron is a combination of properties of the virus replication ability in addition to its ability to avoid pre-existing immune responses.',\n",

The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses.\\nConfiguration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs = .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 42 vaccinated individuals and an additional N = 13 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months.\\nA competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination. The findings raise concern about the duration of vaccine responses and potential need for booster shots.\",\n",

Every country has made great efforts to struggle against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including massive vaccination, immunological patients' surveillance, and the utilization of convalescence plasma for COVID-19 therapy. These efforts are associated with the attempts to increase the titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Abs (nAbs) generated either after infection or vaccination that represent the body's immune status. As there is no standard therapy for COVID-19 yet, virus eradication will mainly depend on these nAbs contents in the body. Therefore, serological nAbs neutralization assays become a requirement for researchers and clinicians to measure nAbs titers. Different platforms have been developed to evaluate nAbs titers utilizing various epitopes sources, including neutralization assays based on the live virus, pseudovirus, and neutralization assays utilizing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein receptor binding site, receptor-binding domain. As a standard neutralization assay, the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) requires isolation and propagation of live pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 virus conducted in a BSL-3 containment. Hence, other surrogate neutralization assays relevant to the PRNT play important alternatives that offer better safety besides facilitating high throughput analyses. This review discusses the current neutralization assay platforms used to evaluate nAbs, their techniques, advantages, and limitations.\",\n",

Using VSV-based pseudovirus, we found that Omicron variant is markedly resistant to neutralization of sera from convalescents or individuals vaccinated by two doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines (BBIBP-CorV). However, a homologous inactivated vaccine booster or a heterologous booster with protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) significantly increased neutralization titers to both WT and Omicron variant. Moreover, at day 14 post the third dose, neutralizing antibody titer reduction for Omicron was less than that for convalescents or individuals who had only two doses of the vaccine, indicating that a homologous or heterologous booster can reduce the Omicron escape from neutralizing. In addition, we tested a panel of 17 SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Omicron resists 7 of 8 authorized/approved mAbs, as well as most of the other mAbs targeting distinct epitopes on RBD and NTD. Taken together, our results suggest the urgency to push forward the booster vaccination to combat the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

Although high rates of vaccine response and adverse reactions of BNT162b2 vaccine have been reported, knowledge about the relationship between sex differences and antibody response is limited. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether adverse reactions are associated with the vaccine response.\\nThis prospective observational study included 673 Japanese participants working in a medical school and its affiliated hospital in Tokyo, Japan (UMIN000043340). Serum samples were collected before the first dose and three weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, and antibody titers against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Answers to questionnaires about background characteristics and adverse reactions were obtained at the time of sample collection, and the relationship between antibody titers was analyzed.\\nAfter excluding participants who did not complete receiving two doses of vaccination or two series of serum sample collection, 646 participants were analyzed. Although all participants became sero-positive after vaccination, antibody titers were highly variable among individuals (260.9-57,399.7A U/mL), with a median titer of 13478.0AU/mL. Mean titer was higher in females than in males and higher in young (≤45\\u202fyears old) participants than in aged (>45\\u202fyears old) participants. Participants who experienced adverse reactions demonstrated a higher antibody titer after vaccination than those without adverse reactions. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that young age, female sex, and adverse reactions after the second dose were independently related to higher antibody titers after the second dose.\\nA favorable antibody response was observed after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination among mostly healthy Japanese participants, especially among female and young participants. Although further investigation is essential, our results imply that the systemic adverse reactions (i.e., fever and general fatigue) are associated with a higher antibody response that indicates the acquisition of humoral immunity.',\n",

A second dose in pre-exposed did not increase antibody levels. Smoking and comorbidities were associated with 43% (95% CI, 19-59) and 45% (95% CI, 63-18) lower neutralization, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 3-57%) and 55% (95% CI, 33-70%) lower antibody levels, respectively.

However, heterogeneity of responses suggests that personalized recommendations may be necessary depending on COVID-19 history and life-style. Higher mRNA-1273 immunogenicity would be beneficial for those expected to respond worse to vaccination and in face of variants that escape immunity such as Omicron.

       "  'abstract': 'Variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge, posing great challenges in outbreak prevention and control. It is important to understand in advance the impact of possible variants of concern (VOCs) on infectivity and antigenicity. Here, we constructed one or more of the 15 high-frequency naturally occurring amino acid changes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants. Single mutant of A520S, V367F, and S494P in above three VOCs enhanced infectivity in ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells of different species, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells. Aggregation of multiple RBD mutations significantly reduces the infectivity of the possible three VOCs. Regarding neutralization, it is noteworthy that E484K, N501Y, K417N, and N439K predispose to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) protection failure in the 15 high-frequency mutations. Most importantly, almost all possible VOCs (single RBD mutation or aggregation of multiple mutations) showed no more than a 4-fold decrease in neutralizing activity with convalescent sera, vaccine sera, and immune sera of guinea pigs with different immunogens, and no significant antigenic drift was formed. In conclusion, our pseudovirus results could reduce the concern that the aggregation of multiple high-frequency mutations in the RBD of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 variants does not lead to severe antigenic drift, and this would provide value for vaccine development strategies.

       "  'abstract': \"The current COVID-19 global pandemic poses immense challenges to global health, largely due to the difficulty to detect infection in the early stages of the disease, as well as the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. Research and understanding of the human immune system can provide important theoretical and technical support for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, the clinical implementations of which include immunoassays and immunotherapy, which play a crucial role in the fight against the pandemic. This review consolidates the current scientific evidence for immunoassay, which includes multiple methods of detecting antigen and antibody against SARS-CoV-2. We compared the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and clinical applications of these three detection techniques. In addition to detecting viral infections, knowledge on the body's immunity against the virus is desirable; thus, the immunotherapy-based neutralizing antibody (nAb) detection methods were discussed. We also gave a brief introduction to the new immunoassay technology such as biosensing. This was followed by an in-depth and extensive review on a variety of immunotherapy methods. It includes convalescent plasma therapy, neutralizing antibody-based treatments targeting different regions of SARS-CoV-2, immunotherapy targeted on the host cell including inhibiting the host cell receptor and cytokine storm, as well as cocktail antibodies, cross-neutralizing antibodies, and immunotherapy based on cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and autoepitopes and autoantibody. Despite the development of various immunological testing methods and antibody therapies, the current global situation of COVID-19 is still tense. We need more efficient detection methods and more reliable antibody therapies. The up-to-date knowledge on therapeutic strategies will likely help clinicians worldwide to protect patients from life-threatening viral infections.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via its spike protein binding to its surface receptor on target cells and results in acute symptoms involving especially the lungs known as COVID-19. However, increasing evidence indicates that many patients develop a chronic condition characterized by fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms, termed long-COVID. Most of the vaccines produced so far for COVID-19 direct mammalian cells via either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to express the spike protein, or administer recombinant spike protein, which is recognized by the immune system leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recent publications provide new findings that may help decipher the pathogenesis of long-COVID. One paper reported perivascular inflammation in brains of deceased patients with COVID-19, while others showed that the spike protein could damage the endothelium in an animal model, that it could disrupt an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and that it can cross the BBB resulting in perivascular inflammation. Moreover, the spike protein appears to share antigenic epitopes with human molecular chaperons resulting in autoimmunity and can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, some antibodies produced against the spike protein may not be neutralizing, but may change its conformation rendering it more likely to bind to its receptor. As a result, one wonders whether the spike protein entering the brain or being expressed by brain cells could activate microglia, alone or together with inflammatory cytokines, since protective antibodies could not cross the BBB, leading to neuro-inflammation and contributing to long-COVID. Hence, there is urgent need to better understand the neurotoxic effects of the spike protein and to consider possible interventions to mitigate spike protein-related detrimental effects to the brain, possibly via use of small natural molecules, especially the flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.',\n",

We have previously reported the highly efficient production of RBD in Pichia pastoris, which is structurally similar to the same protein produced in mammalian HEK-293T cells. In this work we designed an RBD multimer with the purpose of increasing its immunogenicity. We produced multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between RBD expressed in P. pastoris and Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very stable decameric 170\\xa0kDa protein. Such particles were used to vaccinate mice with two doses 30\\xa0days apart. When the particles ratio of RBD to BLS units was high (6-7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer in average), the humoral immune response was significantly higher than that elicited by RBD alone or by RBD-BLS particles with a lower RBD to BLS ratio (1-2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, multimeric particles with a high number of RBD copies elicited a high titer of neutralizing IgGs. These results indicate that multimeric particles composed of RBD covalent coupled to BLS possess an advantageous architecture for antigen presentation to the immune system, and therefore enhancing RBD immunogenicity. Thus, multimeric RBD-BLS particles are promising candidates for a protein-based vaccine.',\n",

Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent patients or individuals vaccinated with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) with 12- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1 (Astra Zeneca-Oxford)/BNT162b2 vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike.

       "  'abstract': 'Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that possess mutations associated with increased transmission and antibody escape have arisen over the course of the current pandemic. Although the current vaccines have largely been effective against past variants, the number of mutations found on the Omicron (B.1.1.529) spike protein appear to diminish the protection conferred by pre-existing immunity. Using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoparticles expressing the spike protein of several SARS-CoV-2 variants, we evaluated the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response over time in individuals after infection and in mRNA-vaccinated individuals. We observed that boosting increases the magnitude of the antibody response to wildtype (D614), Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants; however, the Omicron variant was the most resistant to neutralization. We further observed that vaccinated healthy adults had robust and broad antibody responses whereas responses may have been reduced in vaccinated pregnant women, underscoring the importance of learning how to maximize mRNA vaccine responses in pregnant populations. Findings from this study show substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude and breadth of responses after infection and mRNA vaccination and may support the addition of more conserved viral antigens to existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tracking the evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through genomic surveillance programs is undoubtedly one of the key priorities in the current pandemic situation. Although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations at a slower rate compared with other RNA viruses, evolutionary pressures derived from the widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population have progressively favored the global emergence, though natural selection, of several variants of concern that carry multiple non-synonymous mutations in the spike glycoprotein. These are often placed in key sites within major antibody epitopes and may therefore confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, or otherwise compensate infectivity deficits associated with other non-synonymous substitutions. As previously shown by other authors, several emerging variants carry recurrent deletion regions (RDRs) that display a partial overlap with antibody epitopes located in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Comparatively, very little attention had been directed towards spike insertion mutations prior to the emergence of the B.1.1.529 (omicron) lineage. This manuscript describes a single recurrent insertion region (RIR1) in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, characterized by at least 49 independent acquisitions of 1-8 additional codons between Val213 and Leu216 in different viral lineages. Even though RIR1 is unlikely to confer antibody escape, its association with two distinct formerly widespread lineages (A.2.5 and B.1.214.2), with the quickly spreading omicron and with other VOCs and VOIs warrants further investigation concerning its effects on spike structure and viral infectivity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1965 healthcare workers, of which 381 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in most participants, 96%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 91% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 80% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers. Both anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels were significantly higher in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients four months post infection than in healthcare workers four months post infection (p = 2*10-23 and 2*10-13 respectively). Although the magnitude of humoral response was associated with disease severity, our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies is pivotal for a thorough understating of its evolution during infection. The recent deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, which elicit protective anti-spike neutralizing antibodies, has stressed the importance of uncovering and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated spike proteins. Sequencing databases have allowed to follow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are circulating in the human population, and several experimental platforms were developed to study these variants. However, less is known about the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are developed in the respiratory system of the infected individual. To gain further insight on SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis during natural infection, we preformed single-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from nose-throat swabs of infected individuals. Interestingly, intra-host SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated S genes or N genes were detected in all individuals who were analyzed. These intra-host variants were present in low frequencies in the swab samples and were rarely documented in current sequencing databases. Further examination of representative spike variants identified by our analysis showed that these variants have impaired infectivity capacity and that the mutated variants showed varied sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent plasma and to plasma from vaccinated individuals. Notably, analysis of the plasma neutralization activity against these variants showed that the L1197I mutation at the S2 subunit of the spike can affect the plasma neutralization activity. Together, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variants should be further analyzed for a more thorough characterization of potential circulating variants.',\n",

Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccines, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring the vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase.

       "  'abstract': 'While children have been largely spared from COVID-19 disease, the emergence of viral variants of concern (VOC) with increased transmissibility, combined with fluctuating mask mandates and school re-openings have led to increased infections and disease among children. Thus, there is an urgent need to roll out COVID-19 vaccines to children of all ages. However, whether children respond equivalently to adults to mRNA vaccines and whether dosing will elicit optimal immunity remains unclear. Given the recent announcement of incomplete immunity induced by the pediatric dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in young children, here we aimed to deeply profile and compare the vaccine-induced humoral immune response in 6-11 year old children receiving the pediatric (50μg) or adult (100μg) dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared to adults and naturally infected children or children that experienced multi inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) for the first time. Children elicited an IgG dominant vaccine induced immune response, surpassing adults at a matched 100μg dose, but more variable immunity at a 50μg dose. Irrespective of titer, children generated antibodies with enhanced Fc-receptor binding capacity. Moreover, like adults, children generated cross-VOC humoral immunity, marked by a decline of omicron receptor binding domain-binding, but robustly preserved omicron Spike-receptor binding, with robustly preserved Fc-receptor binding capabilities, in a dose dependent manner. These data indicate that while both 50μg and 100μg of mRNA vaccination in children elicits robust cross-VOC antibody responses, 100ug of mRNA in children results in highly preserved omicron-specific functional humoral immunity.\\nmRNA vaccination elicits robust humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children 6-11 years of age.',\n",

With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single-dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10\\u2009days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to results for control animals. While both i.m. and i.n. vaccination induced neutralizing antibody titers, only i.m. vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of i.m. vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrate that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study. ',\n",

The highly transmissible infection can be contained only by accurate diagnosis, quarantining, and exercising social distancing. Therefore, quick and massive deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing plays a crucial role in the identification and isolation of infected patients. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for COVID-19 detection; however, it needs expertise, facilities, and time. Hence, for the ease of population-wide screening, serology-based diagnostic assays were introduced. These can help determine the prevalence of infection, understand the epidemiology of the disease, and assist in suitable public health interventions while being user-friendly and less time consuming. Although serological testing kits in markets soared, their sensitivity and specificity were questioned in reports from different parts of the world. In this article, we have reviewed 40 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CE-approved clinically evaluated serological kits (8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] kits, 10 chemiluminescent immunoassay [CLIA] kits, and 22 lateral flow immunoassay [LFIA] kits) for their sensitivity and specificity and discussed the apparent reasons behind their performance. We observed appreciable sensitivity in the kits detecting total antibodies compared to the kits targeting single isotype antibodies. Tests that determined antibodies against nucleocapsid protein were found to be more sensitive and those detecting antibodies against spike protein were found to have greater specificity. This study was conducted to help the decision-making while acquiring antibody kits and concurrently to be mindful of their shortcomings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'While the immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been characterized in several well-conducted clinical trials, real-world evidence concerning immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) raised by such vaccines is currently missing. Here, we comprehensively characterized various parameters of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in 126 individuals under real-world conditions. After two doses of vaccination, S-receptor binding domain IgG (S-RBD IgG) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) were detected in 87.06% (74/85) and 78.82% (67/85) of individuals, respectively. Female participants developed higher concentrations of S-RBD IgG and NAb compared to male vaccinees. Interestingly, a longer dosing interval between the first and second vaccination resulted in a better long-term SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG response. The frequencies of CD4+ T cells that produce effector cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) in response to stimulation with peptide pools corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) or membrane (M) protein were significantly higher in individuals received two doses of vaccine than those received one dose of vaccine and unvaccinated individuals. S, N, or M-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were detectable in 95.83% (69/72) and 54.16% (39/72) of double-vaccinated individuals, respectively. The longitudinal analysis demonstrated that CD4+ T cell responses recognizing S, N, and M waned quickly after a single vaccine dose, but were boosted and became more sustained following a second dose. Overall, we provide a comprehensive characterization of immune responses induced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in real-world settings, suggesting that both humoral and cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity are elicited in the majority of individuals after two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

Detection and vaccination are essential for disease control, but they are distinct and complex operations that require significant improvements. Here, we developed an integrated detection and vaccination system to greatly simplify these efforts. We constructed recombinant baculoviruses to separately display the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Insect cells infected by the recombinant baculoviruses were used to generate a cell-based system to accurately detect patient serum. Notably, although well-recognized by our newly developed detection system in which S-displaying insect cells acted as antigen, anti-S antibodies from many patients were barely detectable by Western blot, evidencing that COVID-19 patients primarily produce conformation-dependent anti-S antibodies. Furthermore, the same baculovirus constructs can display N (N-Bac) or S (S-Bac) on the baculovirus envelope and serve as vector vaccines. Animal experiments show that S-Bac or N-Bac immunization in mice elicited a strong and specific antibody response, and S-Bac in particular stimulated effective neutralizing antibodies without the need for adjuvant. Our integrated system maintains antigen conformation and membrane structure to facilitate serum detection and antibody stimulation. Thus, compared with currently available technologies, our system represents a simplified and efficient platform for better SARS-CoV-2 detection and vaccination.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Seventeen years after the epidemic of SARS coronavirus, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2-emerged resulting in an unprecedented pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the SARS coronavirus. Despite many similarities to SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher affinity to ACE2 and shows higher infectivity and transmissibility, resulting in explosive increase of infected people and COVID-19 patients. Emergence of the variants harboring mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein has drawn critical attention to the interaction between ACE2 and Spike and the efficacies of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase which degrades angiotensin II, B1-bradykinin, or apelin, and thereby is a critical regulator of cardiovascular physiology and pathology. In addition, the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by viral and non-viral pneumonias, aspiration, or sepsis. Upon infection, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses downregulates ACE2 expression, likely associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS. Thus, ACE2 is not only the SARS-CoV-2 receptor but might also play an important role in multiple aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis and possibly post-COVID-19 syndromes. Soluble forms of recombinant ACE2 are currently utilized as a pan-variant decoy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and a supplementation of ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Here, we review the role of ACE2 in the pathology of ARDS in COVID-19 and the potential application of recombinant ACE2 protein for treating COVID-19.',\n",

In the present study, a DNA vaccine candidate was generated by combining in tandem envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of dengue virus serotypes 1-4 and a DENV-2 NS1 protein coding region. Each domain was designed as a serotype-specific consensus coding sequence derived from different genotypes based on whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates in India and complemented with data from Africa. This sequence was further optimized for protein expression. In silico structural analysis of the EDIII consensus sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic. Vaccination of mice with this construct induced pan-serotype neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cell responses. Assaying of intracellular IFN-γ staining, immunoglobulin IgG2(a/c)/IgG1 ratios and immune gene profiling suggest a strong Th1-dominant immune response. Finally, passive transfer of immune sera protected AG129 mice challenged with a virulent, non-mouse adapted DENV-2 strain.

       "  'abstract': 'The recently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant omicron displays an unusual association of 30 mutations, 3 deletions, and 1 insertion. To analyze the impact of this atypic mutational landscape, we constructed a complete structure of the omicron spike protein. Compared with the delta variant, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of omicron has an increased electrostatic surface potential, but a decreased affinity for the ACE-2 receptor. The N-terminal domain (NTD) has both a decreased surface potential and a lower affinity for lipid rafts. The omicron variant is predicted to be less fusogenic and thus less pathogenic than delta, due to a geometric reorganization of the S1-S2 cleavage site. Overall, these virological parameters suggest that omicron does not have a significant infectivity advantage over the delta variant. However, in omicron, neutralizing epitopes are greatly affected, suggesting that current vaccines will probably confer little protection against this variant. In conclusion, the puzzling mutational pattern of the omicron variant combines contradictory properties which may either decrease (virological properties) or increase (immunological escape/facilitation) the transmission of this variant in the human population. This Janus-like phenotype may explain some conflicting reports on the initial assessment of omicron and provide new insights about the molecular mechanisms controlling its dissemination and pathogenesis worldwide.',\n",

Receptor-binding domain (RBD)-blocking Abs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD immunoglobulin A\\xa0 (IgA) were evaluated in parallel with interferon gamma (IFNγ)-producing virus-specific T cells. Both vaccines induced RBD-blocking Abs in 100% of the participants after complete immunization while the levels of protection after a single dose largely varied (22%-98%). Advanced age had a negative impact on the level and longevity of virus-neutralizing activity induced by one dose mRNA, but not by the vector vaccine. RBD-binding IgA was detected in 100% of tested donors from the mRNA vaccine cohort, and in 67% of tested from the vector vaccine cohort, at least 1 month after completed immunization. One month after completing\\xa0mRNA immunization, the number of IFNγ-producing T cells correlated significantly with the levels of RBD-specific IgA and virus-neutralizing activity induced after priming. Enumeration of circulating virus-specific IFNγ+ T cells is not recommended for evaluation of protective immunity as their detection may require longer stimulation beyond the firstmonth postimmunization. In conclusion, BNT162B2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 induced potent and comparable humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses, peaking between 10 and 30 days after complete immunization. A single dose of any vaccine did not induce adequate protection in a great part of donors, making the shorter interval between mRNA vaccine doses preferable in the settings of increased risk of infection.',\n",

In this study, epitope screening was performed using a panel of overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequences of the RBD and NP proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from 66 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that while reactivity of patients' sera with reduced recombinant RBD protein was significantly lower than the native form of RBD (p<0.001), no significant differences were observed for reactivity of patients' sera with reduced and non-reduced NP protein. Pepscan analysis revealed weak to moderate reactivity towards different RBD peptide pools, which was more focused on peptides encompassing aa 181-223 of RBD. NP peptides, however, displayed strong reactivity with a single peptide covering aa 151-170. These findings were confirmed by peptide depletion experiments using both ELISA and Western blotting. Altogether, our data suggest involvement of mostly conformational disulfide bond-dependent immunodominant epitopes in RBD-specific antibody response, while the IgG response to NP is dominated by linear epitopes. Identification of dominant immunogenic epitopes in NP and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 could provide important information for the development of passive and active immunotherapy as well as diagnostic tools for the control of COVID-19 infection.\",\n",

The virus enters via nasopharynx, oral and infects cells by the expression of the spike protein, and enters the lungs using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor. The spectrum of specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is increasingly challenging as frequent mutations have been reported and their antigen specificity varies accordingly. The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will have a more significant advantage in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity. Recently, mAbs have been developed to target specific neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of the therapeutic index of mAbs that can elicit neutralization by binding to the viral spike protein and suppress the cytokine network is a classic therapeutic approach for a potential cure. The development of mAbs against B-cell function as well as inhibition of the cytokine network has also been a focus in recent research. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mAbs as antibody cocktail preparations against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Target specific therapeutic accomplishment with mAbs, a milestone in the modern therapeutic age, can be used to achieve a specific therapeutic strategy to suppress SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. This review focuses on the molecular aspects of the cytokine network and antibody formation to better understand the development of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

Vaccine breakthrough cases showed lower memory B cell frequencies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF were lower in vaccine breakthrough infections than primary infection of similar disease severity, underscoring the usefulness of vaccination in preventing inflammation.

Unfortunately, massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations, including people living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein (A.1) from SARS-CoV-2 (repRNA-CoV2S) in immunocompromised, SIV infected and immune competent, naïve pigtail macaques. Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naïve animals. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals.',\n",

The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data and extensively validated by experimental results on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus or about 2.8 times as infectious as the Delta variant. On the basis of 185 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may have an 88% likelihood to escape current vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from AstraZeneca, Regeneron mAb cocktail, Celltrion, and Rockefeller University. However, its impacts on GlaxoSmithKline's sotrovimab appear to be mild.

It has shown us how infectious diseases can cause human existence at stake, and community health is important. The spike protein is the most immunogenic component of the virus. Most vaccine development strategies have focused on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein because it is the most specific target site that recognizes and interacts with human lung cells. Neutralizing antibodies are generated by the humoral immune system and reduce the viral load by binding to spike protein components. Neutralizing antibodies are the proteins secreted by plasma cells and serve as an important part of the defense mechanism. In the recent Covid-19 infection, neutralizing antibodies can be utilized for both diagnostic such as immune surveillance and therapeutic tools such as plasma therapy. So far, many monoclonal antibodies are in the clinical trial phase, and few of them are already in use. In this review, we have discussed details about neutralizing antibodies and their role in combating Covid-19 disease.',\n",

Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission.

Many studies have examined Ab responses in the blood from vaccinated and infected individuals. However, since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, it is also critical to understand the mucosal Ab responses at the sites of initial virus exposure. Here, we examined plasma versus saliva Ab responses in vaccinated and convalescent patients. Although saliva levels were significantly lower, a strong correlation was observed between plasma and saliva total Ig levels against all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested. Virus-specific IgG1 responses predominated in both saliva and plasma, while a lower prevalence of IgM and IgA1 Abs was observed in saliva. Antiviral activities of plasma Abs were also studied. Neutralization titers against the initial WA1 (D614G), B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) strains were similar but lower against the B.1.351 (beta) strain. Spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activities were also detected and the levels correlated with spike-binding Ig titers. Interestingly, while neutralization and ADCP potencies of vaccinated and convalescent groups were comparable, enhanced complement deposition to spike-specific Abs was noted in vaccinated versus convalescent groups and corresponded with higher levels of IgG1 plus IgG3 among the vaccinated individuals. Altogether, this study demonstrates the detection of Ab responses after vaccination or infection in plasma and saliva that correlate significantly, although Ig isotypic differences were noted. The induced plasma Abs displayed Fab-mediated and Fc-dependent functions with comparable neutralization and ADCP potencies, but a greater capacity to activate complement was elicited upon vaccination.',\n",

Various serological immunoassays based on different analytical techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ELISA; chemiluminescence immunoassay, CLIA; electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, ECLIA; and lateral flow immunoassay, LFI), epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (nucleocapsid, N; receptor-binding domain, RBD; extended RBD, RBD+; S1 or S2 domain of the spike [S] protein, S1/S2), and antibody subtypes (IgG, pan-Ig) were conducted.

Although mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, and vaccinations help curb viral transmission, there is a pressing need for cost-effective systems to mitigate the viral spread. Here, we present a generic strategy for capturing SARS-CoV-2 through functionalized cellulose materials. Specifically, we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody (Nb) targeting the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The immobilization of the fusion proteins on cellulose substrates enhanced the capture efficiency of Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses of the wildtype and the D614G variant, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose to capture viruses from complex fluids in a continuous fashion. By capturing and containing viruses through the Nb-functionalized cellulose, our work may find utilities in virus sampling and filtration towards paper-based diagnostics, environmental tracking of viral spread and reducing viral load from infected individuals.

Noninvasive sampling methods are advantageous for reducing the need for venipuncture, which may be a barrier to investigations, particularly in pediatric populations. Oral fluids are obtained by gingiva-crevicular sampling from children and adults and are very well accepted. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) based on these samples have acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional serum-based antibody EIAs and are suitable for population-based surveillance. We describe the development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG EIAs using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike (S) proteins in IgG isotype capture format and an indirect receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG EIA, intended for use in children as a primary endpoint. All three assays were assessed using a panel of 1,999 paired serum and oral fluids from children and adults participating in school SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies during and after the first and second pandemic wave in the United Kingdom. The anti-NP IgG capture assay was the best candidate, with an overall sensitivity of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71 to 79%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI: 78 to 99%) compared with paired serum antibodies. Sensitivity observed in children (80%, 95% CI: 71 to 88%) was higher than that in adults (67%, CI: 60% to 74%).

Owing to their high specificity and reliability, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as powerful tools to treat and detect numerous diseases. Hence, many researchers have begun to urgently develop Ab-based kits for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ab drugs for use as COVID-19 therapeutic agents. The detailed structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known, and since this protein is key for viral infection, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) has become a major target for therapeutic Ab development. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with a high mutation rate, especially under the selective pressure of aggressively deployed prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing Abs, the use of Ab cocktails is expected to be an important strategy for effective COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection may stimulate an overactive immune response, resulting in a cytokine storm that drives severe disease progression. Abs to combat cytokine storms have also been under intense development as treatments for COVID-19. In addition to their use as drugs, Abs are currently being utilized in SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, including antigen and immunoglobulin tests. Such Ab-based detection tests are crucial surveillance tools that can be used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Adsorption of a poly(acrylic acid)-containing film in membrane pores and activation of the -COOH groups in the film enable covalent-linking of affinity peptides or proteins to the membrane. Passage of mAb-containing serum through the affinity membrane results in mAb capture within 1 min. Subsequent rinsing, binding of a secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore, and a second rinse yield mAb-concentration-dependent fluorescence intensities in the wells. Calibration curves established from analyses on different days have low variability and allow determination of mAb levels in separately prepared samples with an average error <10%, although errors in single-replicate measurements may reach 40%. The assays can occur in diluted serum with physiologically relevant mAb concentrations, as well as in undiluted serum. Thus, the combination of 96-well plates containing affinity membranes, a microplate reader, and a simple vacuum manifold affords convenient mAb quantitation in <5 min.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite the dramatic spread of Omicron globally, even among highly vaccinated populations, death rates have not increased concomitantly. These data argue that alternative immune mechanisms, beyond neutralization, may continue to confer protection against severe disease. Beyond their ability to bind and block infection, antibodies contribute to control and clearance of multiple infections via their ability to direct antiviral immunity via Fc-effector mechanisms. Thus, here we probed the ability of vaccine induced antibodies, across three COVID-19 vaccines, to drive Fc-effector activity against Omicron. Despite the significant loss of IgM, IgA and IgG binding to the Omicron Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) across BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccines, stable isotype binding was observed across all of these vaccines to the Omicron Spike. Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a significant loss of cross RBD-specific antibody Fcγ-receptor binding by the CoronaVac vaccine, but preservation of RBD-specific FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding across the mRNA vaccines. Conversely, Spike-specific antibodies exhibited persistent binding to Fcγ-receptors, across all three vaccines, albeit higher binding was observed with the mRNA vaccines, marked by a selective preservation of FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding antibodies. Thus, despite the significant to near complete loss of Omicron neutralization across several vaccine platforms against Omicron, vaccine induced Spike-specific antibodies continue to recognize the virus and recruit Fc-receptors pointing to a persistent capacity for extra-neutralizing antibodies to contribute Omicron disease attenuation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"COVID-19 has affected billions of people around the world directly or indirectly. The response to the pandemic has focused on preventing the spread of the disease and improving treatment options. Diagnostic technologies have played a key role in this response since the beginning of the pandemic. As vaccines and other treatments have been developed and deployed, interest in understanding and measuring the individual level of immune protection has increased. Historically, use of antibody titers to measure systemic immunity has been constrained by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between antibodies and immunity, the lack of international standards for antibody concentration to enable cross-study comparisons, and insufficient clinical data to allow for the development of robust antibody-immunity models. However, these constraints have recently shifted. With a deeper understanding of antibodies, the promulgation of WHO antibody standards, and the development of immunity models using datasets from multiple COVID-19 vaccine trials, certain types of quantitative antibody tests may now provide a way to monitor individual or community immunity against COVID-19. Specifically, tests that quantitate the concentration of anti-RBD IgG -antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the S1 spike protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - show promise as a useful and scalable measure of the COVID-19 immunity of both individuals and communities. However, to fulfill this promise, a rapid and easy-to-administer test is needed. To address this important clinical need, Brevitest deployed its point-of-care-capable technology platform that can run a rapid (<15 minute), quantitative antibody test with a sample of 10 μl of whole blood from a fingerstick. The test we validated on this platform measures the concentration of anti-RBD IgG in Binding Antibody Units per milliliter (BAU/mL) per WHO Reference Standard NIBSC 20/136. In this paper, we present studies used to characterize the Brevitest anti-RBD IgG assay and evaluate its clinical performance, lower limits of measurement, precision, linearity, interference, and cross-reactivity. The results demonstrate the ability of this assay to measure a patient's anti-RBD IgG concentration. This information, together with models developed from recent COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, can provide a means of assessing the current level of immune protection of an individual or community against COVID-19 infection.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus contains extensive sequence changes relative to the earlier arising B.1, B.1.1 and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants that have unknown effects on viral infectivity and response to existing vaccines. Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron showed increased infectivity relative to B.1, B.1.1 and similar to Delta, a property conferred by S and N protein mutations. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with tozinameran (Pfizer/BioNTech), elasomeran (Moderna), Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had moderately to dramatically reduced efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine antisera showed strong neutralizing activity against VLPs possessing the ancestral spike protein (B.1, B.1.1), with 3-fold reduced efficacy against Delta and 15-fold lower neutralization against Omicron VLPs. Johnson & Johnson antisera showed minimal neutralization of any of the VLPs tested. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics Casirivimab and Imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1, B.1.1 or Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs. Our results suggest that Omicron is at least as efficient at assembly and cell entry as Delta, and the antibody response triggered by existing vaccines or previous infection, at least prior to boost, will have limited ability to neutralize Omicron. In addition, some currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 along with its high number of mutations in the spike gene has raised alarm about the effectiveness of current medical countermeasures. To address this concern, we measured neutralizing antibodies against Omicron in three important settings: (1) post-vaccination sera after two and three immunizations with the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine, (2) convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by different variants, and (3) clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies. Using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, we found that titers against Omicron were low or undetectable after two immunizations and in most convalescent sera. A booster vaccination significantly increased titers against Omicron to levels comparable to those seen against the ancestral (D614G) variant after two immunizations. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in post-vaccination antibody responses. Only three of 24 therapeutic antibodies tested retained their full potency against Omicron and high-level resistance was seen against fifteen. These findings underscore the potential benefit of booster mRNA vaccines for protection against Omicron and the need for additional therapeutic antibodies that are more robust to highly mutated variants.\\nThird dose of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine significantly boosts neutralizing antibodies to the Omicron variant compared to a second dose, while neutralization of Omicron by convalescent sera, two-dose vaccine-elicited sera, or therapeutic antibodies is variable and often low.',\n",

Through six months after the 2nd dose, none of the sera from naïve vaccinated subjects showed neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. In contrast, recovered vaccinated individuals showed a 22-fold reduction with more than half of the subjects retaining neutralizing antibody responses. Following a booster shot (3rd dose), we observed a 14-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant and over 90% of boosted subjects showed neutralizing activity against the omicron variant.

A key test for potential countermeasures against B.1.1.529 is their activity in pre-clinical rodent models of respiratory tract disease.

Despite modeling and binding data suggesting that B.1.1.529 spike can bind more avidly to murine ACE2, we observed attenuation of infection in 129, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice as compared with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, with limited weight loss and lower viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Although K18-hACE2 transgenic mice sustained infection in the lungs, these animals did not lose weight. In wild-type and hACE2 transgenic hamsters, lung infection, clinical disease, and pathology with B.1.1.529 also were milder compared to historical isolates or other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Methods In this prospective cohort study, participants received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on days 0 and 21 and provided blood for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing before the first vaccine and on days 21 and 35 after vaccination. Anti-spike protein immunoglobulin G (S-IgG) was measured using Abbott and Fujirebio chemiluminescent immunoassays. Participants One hundred healthcare workers (median age: 39 years old, interquartile range: 30-48 years old), including 6 who had been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 3 individuals taking immunosuppressive drugs, participated in the study. Results The S-IgG antibody titers (AU/mL) measured using both the Abbott and Fujirebio assays increased significantly (p<0.001) over time, both with a prevalence of 100% at 35 days after the first vaccination. The multivariate log-normal linear regression analysis indicated the effect of immunosuppressant medication using both the Abbott (p=0.013) and Fujirebio (p=0.039) assays on S-IgG levels after complete vaccination.

Aim of the study was to evaluate the antibody level against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients treated with two different mRNA-based vaccines, in a multicenter survey.\\nSince April 2020, in the 5 participating Centers, periodic screening of all patients with PCR testing has been performed every 2 weeks. The study included two cohorts of patients on maintenance hemodialysis treated with the BNT162b2 or with the mRNA-1273 Covid-19 vaccine. The tests for antibodies against the receptor-binding domain was performed by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S enzyme immunoassay (Roche Elecsys).\\nOf the 398 included patients, 303 received the BNT162b2 and 95 the mRNA-1273 vaccine. In patients without previous infection, the median levels of anti-S antibodies were 297 U/mL and 1,032 U/mL for those treated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, respectively (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).

       "  'abstract': 'Persistence of protective immunity for SARS-CoV-2 is important against reinfection. Knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 immunity in pediatric patients is currently lacking. We opted to assess the SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity in recovered children and adolescents, addressing the pediatrics specific immunity towards COVID-19. Two independent assays were performed to investigate humoral and cellular immunological memory in pediatric convalescent COVID-19 patients. Specifically, RBD IgG, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell responses were identified and quantified in recovered children and adolescents. SARS-CoV-2-specific RBD IgG detected in recovered patients had a half-life of 121.6 days and estimated duration of 7.9 months compared with baseline levels in controls. The specific T cell response was shown to be independent of days after diagnosis. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed robust responses not only to spike (S) peptides (a main target of vaccine platforms) but were also similarly activated when stimulated by membrane (M) and nuclear (N) peptides. Importantly, we found the differences in the adaptive responses were correlated with the age of the recovered patients. The CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 S peptide in children aged <12 years correlated with higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels, suggesting the importance of a T cell-dependent humoral response in younger children under 12 years. Both cellular and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infections can be induced in pediatric patients. Our important findings provide fundamental knowledge on the immune memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 in recovered pediatric patients.',\n",

We isolated and analyzed 126 monoclonal antibodies, many of which were sarbecovirus cross-reactive, with some displaying merbecovirus- and embecovirus-reactivity. Several isolated broadly neutralizing antibodies were effective against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429, B.1.617, and B.1.617.2 variants and 19 prominent potential escape sites. Furthermore, assembly of 716,806 SARS-CoV-2 sequences predicted emerging escape variants, which were also effectively neutralized. One of these broadly neutralizing potent antibodies, R40-1G8, is a IGHV3-53 RBD-class-1 antibody. Remarkably, cryo-EM analysis revealed that R40-1G8 has a flexible binding mode, targeting both \"up\" and \"down\" conformations of the RBD.

According to the mass-action law, a lesser concentration of tightly binding antibody can produce the same quantity of antibody-antigen complexes as higher concentrations of lower affinity antibody. Thus, measurements of antibody levels reflect both affinity and concentration. These two fundamental parameters cannot be disentangled in clinical immunoassays, and so produce a bias which depends on the assay format.\\nTo determine the apparent affinity of anti-spike protein antibodies, a small number of antigen-coated magnetic microparticles were imaged by fluorescence microscopy after probing antigen-antibody equilibria directly in patient plasma.

We have collected serial samples from 23 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms and measured the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory samples and markers of inflammation in serum samples. We monitored seroconversion during the acute phase of illness and quantitated the amount of total IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and estimated the virus neutralization potential of these antibodies. Viral load decreased by day 8 in all the patients but the detection of viral RNA in saliva samples did not correlate well with viral RNA detection in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples. 25% of the virus-positive patients had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in the serum and in other cases, the efficiency of antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 strain was lower as compared to the circulating virus isolate. Decrease in viral load coincided with increase in neutralizing antibodies and interferon levels in serum. Most patients showed no increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β or IL-6, however, elevated levels of IL-7 and other inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-8 was observed. These data suggest that most mild infections are associated with absence of inflammation coupled with an active innate immune response, T-cell activation and neutralizing antibodies.',\n",

We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, which we refer to as 'NanoSpot.ai', is suitable for POC testing, can be manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is growing evidence that antibody responses play a role in the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency are at increased risk of persistent infection. This challenging clinical scenario is associated with adverse patient outcome and potentially creates an ecological niche for the evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion capacity. Case reports and/or series have implied a therapeutic role for convalescent plasma (CP) to secure virological clearance, although concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of CP and its potential to drive viral evolution, and it has largely been withdrawn from clinical use in the UK.\\nWe report two cases in which persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared following administration of the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2, Ronapreve). A 55-year-old male with follicular lymphoma, treated with B cell depleting therapy, developed SARS-CoV-2 infection in September 2020 which then persisted for over 200\\xa0days. He was hospitalised on four occasions with COVID-19 and suffered debilitating fatigue and malaise throughout. There was no clinical response to antiviral therapy with remdesivir or CP, and SARS-CoV-2 was consistently detected in nasopharyngeal swabs. Intrahost evolution of several spike variants of uncertain significance was identified by viral sequence analysis. Delivery of REGN-COV2, in combination with remdesivir, was associated with clinical improvement and viral clearance within 6\\xa0days, which was sustained for over 150\\xa0days despite immunotherapy for relapsed follicular lymphoma. The second case, a 68-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on ibrutinib, also developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite a lack of response to remdesivir, infection promptly cleared following REGN-COV2 in combination with remdesivir, accompanied by resolution of inflammation and full clinical recovery that has been maintained for over 290\\xa0days.\\nThese cases highlight the potential benefit of REGN-COV2 as therapy for persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in antibody deficient individuals, including after failure of CP treatment. Formal clinical studies are warranted to assess the effectiveness of REGN-COV2 in antibody-deficient patients, especially in light of the emergence of variants of concern, such as Omicron, that appear to evade REGN-COV2 neutralisation.',\n",

Several major variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and posed challenges in controlling the pandemic.

We have modelled the complex structure of the human ACE2 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Omicron Spike protein (S-protein), and conducted atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding interactions. The analysis shows that the Omicron RBD binds more strongly to the human ACE2 protein than the original strain.

In this study, we use pseudoviruses and reveal that the spike protein of the Lambda variant is more infectious than that of other variants due to the T76I and L452Q mutations. The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, a unique 7-amino acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda spike protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies and further augments antibody-mediated enhancement of infection. Although this mutation generates a nascent N-linked glycosylation site, the additional N-linked glycan is dispensable for the virological property conferred by this mutation. Since the Lambda variant has dominantly spread according to the increasing frequency of the isolates harboring the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, our data suggest that the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is closely associated with the substantial spread of the Lambda variant in South America.',\n",

Therefore, we analyzed samples from the same individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We found hCCCoV antibody levels increase after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, demonstrating cross-reactivity. However, a case-control study indicates that baseline hCCCoV antibody levels are not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in mice.

Transcript expression analysis identified 117 (bro-ALI) and 97 (alv-ALI) differentially regulated genes (\\nIn conclusion, we observed a typical anti-viral response in the bronchial model and a pro-fibrotic response in the alveolar model. The bro-ALI and alv-ALI models may serve as an easy and robust platform for assessing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern at different lung regions.',\n",

Here, we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 pseudoviruses, but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses. Among twenty-three therapeutic antibodies tested, four antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and six antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 and AY.1 pseudoviruses. Our results indicate that the current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants. Finally, the P681R substitution confers efficient cleavage of B.1.617 variants' spike proteins and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.\",\n",

Whether the viral antibodies exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is still not fully understood. Here, we conducted in vitro assessment of whether convalescent serum enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection or induced excessive immune responses in immune cells. Our data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells, macrophages and monocytes, which express variable levels of FcγR, could be enhanced by convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients. We also determined the factors associated with ADE, and found which showed a time-dependent but not viral-dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the ADE effect is not associated with the neutralizing titer or RBD antibody level when testing serum samples collected from different patients. However, it is higher in a medium level than low or high dilutions in a given sample that showed ADE effect, which is similar to dengue. Finally, we demonstrated more viral genes or dysregulated host immune gene expression under ADE conditions compared to the no-serum infection group. Collectively, our study provides insight into the understanding of an association of high viral antibody titer and severe lung pathology in severe patients with COVID-19.',\n",

The procedure requires a small amount of S-protein/RBD and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). A high-throughput, simple ELISA technique is employed. Plate-coated-RBDs are allowed to interact with the serum, then soluble ACE2 is added, followed by secondary antibodies and substrate. The key steps in this procedure include (1) serum heat treatment to prevent non-specific interactions, (2) proper use of blank controls to detect side reactions and eliminate secondary antibody cross-reactivity, (3) the addition of an optimal amount of saturating ACE2 to maximize sensitivity and prevent non-competitive co-occurrence of RBD-ACE2 binding and neutralization, and (4) mechanistically derived neutralization calculation using a calibration curve. Even manually, the protocol can be completed in 16 h for >30 serum samples; this includes the 7.5 h of incubation time.

Yellow fever virus 17D (YF17D) is a live-attenuated virus vaccine with an impressive efficacy record in humans, and therefore, it is a very attractive platform for the development of novel chimeric vaccines against various pathogens. In the present study, we generated a YF17D-based replicon vaccine platform by replacing the prM and E surface proteins of YF17D with antigenic subdomains from the spike (S) proteins of three different betacoronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV. The prM and E proteins were provided in trans for the packaging of these RNA replicons into single-round infectious particles capable of expressing coronavirus antigens in infected cells. YF17D replicon particles expressing the S1 regions of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike proteins were immunogenic in mice and elicited (neutralizing) antibody responses against both the YF17D vector and the coronavirus inserts. Thus, YF17D replicon-based vaccines, and their potential DNA- or mRNA-based derivatives, may constitute a promising and particularly safe vaccine platform for current and future emerging coronaviruses.',\n",

Sixteen pwMS treated with ocrelizumab or rituximab received a third homologous SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, either the Moderna mRNA-1273 or Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine.

A total of 37 linear epitopes were identified. A total of 26 of these epitopes were almost exclusively recognized by the convalescent sera. Mapping these epitopes to the spike structures revealed that most of these 26 epitopes are masked in the pre-fusion structure.

       "  'abstract': 'Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to SARS-CoV-2 are clinically efficacious when administered early, decreasing hospitalization and mortality in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. We investigated the effects of receiving mAbs (bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together) after SARS-CoV-2 infection on the endogenous immune response.\\nLongitudinal serum samples were collected from patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 in the BLAZE-1 trial who received placebo (n=153), bamlanivimab alone [700 mg (n=100), 2800 mg (n=106), or 7000 mg (n=98)], or bamlanivimab (2800 mg) and etesevimab (2800 mg) together (n=111). A multiplex Luminex serology assay measured antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including SARS-CoV-2 protein variants that evade bamlanivimab or etesevimab binding, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed.\\nThe antibody response in patients who received placebo or mAbs had a broad specificity. Titer change from baseline against a receptor-binding domain mutant (Spike-RBD E484Q), as well as N-terminal domain (Spike-NTD) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) epitopes were 1.4 to 4.1 fold lower at day 15-85 in mAb recipients compared with placebo. Neutralizing activity of day 29 sera from bamlanivimab monotherapy cohorts against both spike E484Q and beta variant (B.1.351) were slightly reduced compared with placebo (by a factor of 3.1, p=0.001, and 2.9, p=0.002, respectively). Early viral load correlated with the subsequent antibody titers of the native, unmodified humoral response (p<0.0001 at Day 15, 29, 60 and 85 for full-length spike).\\nPatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 treated with mAbs develop a wide breadth of antigenic responses to SARS-CoV-2. Small reductions in titers and neutralizing activity, potentially due to a decrease in viral load following mAb treatment, suggest minimal impact of mAb treatment on the endogenous immune response.',\n",

This paper reports the construction of the pVAX-RBD plasmid containing the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the S protein and a unique signal sequence 176 which promotes target protein secretion into the extracellular space thereby increasing the efficiency of humoral immune response activation. A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate (PGS) was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells. The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice. In particular, RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1 : 1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1 : 42\\u2009000, in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group. The pVAX-RBD‒PGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response. Using ELISpot, it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF-γ in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool. The results suggest that the polyglucine-spermidine conjugate-enveloped pVAX-RBD construct may be considered as a promising DNA vaccine against COVID-19.',\n",

In this study, we serially measured the serum titers of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies generated against the nucleocapsid protein (NCP), S1 subunit of the spike protein (S1), and receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in Japanese individuals with COVID-19. Among the IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies, IgA antibodies against all of the aforementioned viral proteins were the first to appear after the infection, and IgG and/or IgA seroconversion often preceded IgM seroconversion. In regard to the timeline of the antibody responses to the different viral proteins (NCP, S1 and RBD), IgA against NCP appeared than IgA against S1 or RBD, while IgM and IgG against S1 appeared earlier than IgM/IgG against NCP or RBD. The IgG responses to all three viral proteins and responses of all three antibody classes to S1 and RBD were sustained for longer durations than the IgA/IgM responses to all three viral proteins and responses of all three antibody classes to NCP, respectively. The seroconversion of IgA against NCP occurred later and less frequently in patients with mild COVID-19.

Intramuscular immunization of two doses of ARCoV elicited robust neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular response against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques. More importantly, ARCoV vaccination in macaques significantly protected animals from acute lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2, and viral replication in lungs and secretion in nasal swabs were completely cleared in all animals immunized with low or high doses of ARCoV. No evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection was observed throughout the study.

We produced a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and recognizes N protein in cell lysates of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells but not in cell lysates of MERS-CoV- or HCoV-OC43-infected Vero cells. This antibody recognized N protein in SARS-CoV-2 clades S, GR, and GH and recognized N protein in all the SARS-CoV-2 clades to ∼300 pfu. Previously, we reported that the coronavirus N protein interacts with the C-terminal domain of the spike protein (Spike CD). In this study, we developed an ELISA-based \"bait and prey\" system to confirm the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike CD and N protein using recombinant fusion proteins. Furthermore, this system can be modified to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 in culture media of infected cells by monitoring the interaction between the recombinant Spike CD fusion protein and the viral N protein, which is captured by the N protein-specific antibody. Therefore, we conclude that our N protein-specific monoclonal antibody and our ELISA-based bait and prey system could be used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections.',\n",

Phage-based vaccines were described previously, and we explored the possibility of using mycobacteriophages as a platform for displaying antigens of SARS-CoV-2 or other infectious agents. The potential advantages of using mycobacteriophages are that a large and diverse variety of them have been described and genomically characterized, engineering tools are available, and there is the capacity to display up to 700 antigen copies on a single particle approximately 100 nm in size. The phage body may itself be a good adjuvant, and the phages can be propagated easily, cheaply, and to high purity. Furthermore, the recent use of these phages therapeutically, including by intravenous administration, suggests an excellent safety profile, although efficacy can be restricted by neutralizing antibodies.

The aim of this work is to study the production of circulating immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with past infection in Cyprus. Individuals of the general population, with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, were invited to visit the Biobank at the Center of Excellence in Biobanking and Biomedical Research of the University of Cyprus. Serum IgG antibodies were measured using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assays of Abbott Laboratories. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were also evaluated against participants' demographic and clinical data. All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata 16. The median levels of receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG in 969 unvaccinated individuals, who were reportedly infected between November 2020 and September 2021, were 432.1 arbitrary units (AI)/mL (interquartile range-IQR: 182.4-1147.3). Higher antibody levels were observed in older participants, males, and those who reportedly developed symptoms or were hospitalized. The RBD-specific IgG levels peaked at three months post symptom onset and subsequently decreased up to month six, with a slower decay thereafter. IgG response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is bi-phasic with considerable titer variability. Levels of IgG are significantly associated with several parameters, including age, gender, and severity of symptoms.\",\n",

This study aims to evaluate the potential of indirect immunofluorescence as an in-house diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 antigens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Three primary antibodies raised from mice were used for immunofluorescence staining, including monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Smears of cells from NPS of 29 COVID-19 patients and 20 non-infected individuals, and cells from viral culture were stained by the three antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify respiratory epithelial cells with positive signals. Polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 N protein had the highest sensitivity and specificity among the three antibodies tested, detecting 17 out of 29 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other tested viruses except SARS-CoV. Detection of virus-infected cells targeting SARS-CoV-2 N protein allow identification of infected individuals, although accuracy is limited by sample quality and number of respiratory epithelial cells. The potential of immunofluorescence as a simple diagnostic method was demonstrated, which could be applied by incorporating antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into multiplex immunofluorescence panels used clinically, such as for respiratory viruses, thus allowing additional routine testing for diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 even after the epidemic has ended with low prevalence of COVID-19.',\n",

Here, we report a dual-detection fluorescent immunochromatographic assay (DFIA), with a built-in self-calibration process, that enables rapid quantitative detection of neutralizing antibodies that block binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, this assay is based on the inhibition of binding between ACE2 and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by neutralizing antibodies, and the affinity of anti-human immunoglobulins for these neutralizing antibodies. Our self-calibrating DFIA shows improved precision and sensitivity with a wider dynamic linear range, due to the incorporation of a ratiometric algorithm of two-reverse linkage signals responding to an analyte. This was evident by the fact that no positive results (0/14) were observed in verified negative samples, while 22 positives were detected in 23 samples from verified convalescent plasma. A comparative analysis of the ability to detect neutralizing antibodies in 266 clinical serum samples including those from vaccine recipients, indicated that the overall percent agreement between DFIA and the commercial ELISA kit was 90.98%. Thus, the proposed DFIA provides a more reliable and accurate rapid test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations in the community. Therefore, the DFIA based strategy for detecting biomarkers, which uses a ratiometric algorithm based on affinity and inhibition reactions, may be applied to improve the performance of immunochromatographic assays.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Costimulatory and coinhibitory mechanisms appear to be involved throughout immune responses to control their specificity and level. Many mechanisms operate; therefore, various theoretical models should be considered complementary rather than competing. One such coinhibitory model, pictured in 1971, involves the crosslinking of antigen receptors with inhibitory Fc receptors by antigen/antibody complexes. This model was prompted by observations that the Fc portion of antibody was required for potent suppression of immune responses by antibody. The signal via the antigen receptor wakes up T or B cells, providing specificity, while costimulators and coinhibitors stimulate or inhibit these awoken cells. The recent observations that administration of monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in early COVID-19 patients inhibits the induction of clinically damaging autoimmune antibodies suggest they may provide negative Fc signals that are blocked in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the reduced ability of SARS-CoV-2 antigen to localize to germinal centres in COVID-19 patients also suggests a block in binding of the Fc of antibody bound to antigen on FcγRIIb of follicular dendritic cells. The distinction between self and foreign is made not only at the beginning of immune responses but also throughout, and involves multiple mechanisms and models.

       "  'abstract': \"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged towards the end of 2019 that caused a severe respiratory disease in humans called COVID-19. It led to a pandemic with a high rate of morbidity and mortality that is ongoing and threatening humankind. Most of the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are synonymous or deleterious, but a few of them produce improved viral functions. The first known mutation associated with higher transmissibility, D614G, was detected in early 2020. Since then, the virus has evolved; new mutations have occurred, and many variants have been described. Depending on the genes affected and the location of the mutations, they could provide altered infectivity, transmissibility, or immune escape. To date, mutations that cause variations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been among the most studied because of the protein's role in the initial virus-cell contact and because it is the most variable region in the virus genome. Some concerning mutations associated with an impact on viral fitness have been described in the Spike protein, such as D614G, N501Y, E484K, K417N/T, L452R, and P681R, among others. To understand the impact of the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus, the mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has been under constant global scrutiny. The virus variants are defined according to their origin, their genetic profile (some characteristic mutations prevalent in the lineage), and the severity of the disease they produce, which determines the level of concern. If they increase fitness, new variants can outcompete others in the population. The Alpha variant was more transmissible than previous versions and quickly spread globally. The Beta and Gamma variants accumulated mutations that partially escape the immune defenses and affect the effectiveness of vaccines. Nowadays, the Delta variant, identified around March 2021, has spread and displaced the other variants, becoming the most concerning of all lineages that have emerged. The Delta variant has a particular genetic profile, bearing unique mutations, such as T478K in the spike protein and M203R in the nucleocapsid. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the different mutations that have appeared in SARS-CoV-2, mainly on the spike protein. It analyzes their impact on the protein function and, subsequently, on the level of concern of different variants and their importance in the ongoing pandemic.\",\n",

Despite the significant progress in methods and devices for nucleic acid amplification, immunochemical methods are still preferred for mass testing without specialized laboratories and highly qualified personnel. The most widely used immunoassays are microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with photometric detection and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) with visual results assessment. However, the disadvantage of ELISA is its considerable duration, and that of LFIA is its low sensitivity. In this study, the modified LFIA of a specific antigen of the causative agent of COVID-19, spike receptor-binding domain, was developed and characterized. This modified LFIA includes the use of gold nanoparticles with immobilized antibodies and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotag and registration of the nanotag binding by SERS spectrometry. To enhance the sensitivity of LFIA-SERS analysis, we determined the optimal compositions of SERS nanotags and membranes used in LFIA. For benchmark comparison, ELISA and conventional colorimetric LFIA were used with the same immune reagents. The proposed method combines a low detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL (at 0.4 ng/mL for ELISA and 1 ng/mL for qualitative LFIA) with a short assay time equal to 20 min (at 3.5 h for ELISA and 15 min for LFIA). The results obtained demonstrate the promise of using the SERS effects in membrane immuno-analytical systems.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and anti-S-receptor binding domain (RBD IgGs) against SARS-CoV-2 after full vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for up to 9 months in healthy individuals (NCT04743388). The assessments were performed at the following time points after the second vaccination: 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The measurements were performed with the GenScript's cPassTM SARS-CoV-2 NAbs Detection Kit (GenScript, Inc.; Piscataway, NJ) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH; Mannheim, Germany). Three hundred nine participants with a median age of 48 years were included. A gradual decline in both NAbs and anti-S-RBD IgGs became evident from 2 weeks to 9 months postvaccination. Both NAbs and anti-S-RBD IgGs levels were significantly lower at 9 months compared with the previous timepoints. Interestingly, age was found to exert a statistically significant effect on NAbs elimination only during the first-trimester postvaccination, as older age was associated with a more rapid clearance of NAbs. Furthermore, simulation studies predicted that the median NAb value would fall from 66% at 9 months to 59% and 45% at 12 and 18 months postvaccination, respectively. This finding may reflect a declining degree of immune protection against COVID-19 and advocates for the administration of booster vaccine shots especially in areas with emerging outbreaks.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally mild or asymptomatic in children but a biological basis for this outcome is unclear. Here we compare antibody and cellular immunity in children (aged 3-11 years) and adults. Antibody responses against spike protein were high in children and seroconversion boosted responses against seasonal Beta-coronaviruses through cross-recognition of the S2 domain. Neutralization of viral variants was comparable between children and adults. Spike-specific T cell responses were more than twice as high in children and were also detected in many seronegative children, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive responses to seasonal coronaviruses. Importantly, children retained antibody and cellular responses 6 months after infection, whereas relative waning occurred in adults. Spike-specific responses were also broadly stable beyond 12 months. Therefore, children generate robust, cross-reactive and sustained immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 with focused specificity for the spike protein. These findings provide insight into the relative clinical protection that occurs in most children and might help to guide the design of pediatric vaccination regimens.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than is SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the authentic variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccinee sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.',\n",

Especially individuals over 60 years of age or with underlying co-morbidities including heart or lung disease, and diabetes or immune compromised patients are at higher risk. Fatal multi-organ damage in COVID19 patients can be attributed to Interleukin (IL-)6 dominated cytokine storm. Consequently, IL-6R monoclonal antibody treatment for severe COVID19 cases has been approved for therapy. High concentrations of soluble IL-6R were found in COVID19 intensive care unit patients suggesting the involvement of IL-6 trans-signaling in disease pathology. Here, in analogy to bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), we developed the first bispecific IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor c19s130Fc which blocks viral infection and IL-6 trans-signaling. c19s130Fc is a designer protein of the IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor cs130 fused to a single domain nanobody directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. c19s130Fc binds with high affinity to IL-6:sIL6R complexes as well as the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 as shown by surface plasmon resonance. Using cell-based assays, we demonstrate that c19s130Fc blocks IL-6 trans-signaling-induced proliferation and STAT3 phosphorylation of Ba/F3-gp130 cells as well as SARS-CoV2 infection and STAT3 phosphorylation in Vero cells. Taken together, c19s130Fc represents a new class of bispecific inhibitors consisting of a soluble cytokine receptor fused to anti-viral nanobodies and principally demonstrates the multi-functionalization of trans-signaling inhibitors.

Although IgM/IgG serology assay has been widely used, with the entire spike or nucleocapsid antigens, they only indicate the presence or absence of antibodies against these proteins but are not specific to the neutralization antibodies, therefore providing only generic information about infection stage and possible future immune protection. Novel technologies enabling easy-to-use and sensitive detection of multiple specific antibodies simultaneously will facilitate precise diagnosis of infection stage, prediction of clinical outcomes, and evaluation of future immune protection upon viral exposure or vaccination. Here, we demonstrate a rapid and ultrasensitive quantification method for epitope-specific antibodies, including different isotypes and subclasses, in a multiplexed manner. Using an ultrabright fluorescent nanolabel, plasmonic-fluor, this novel assay can be completed in 20 min and more importantly, the limit of detection of the plasmon-enhanced immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is as much as 100-fold lower compared to the assays relying on enzymatic amplification of colorimetric signals. Using convalescent patient plasma, we demonstrate that this biodetection method reveals the patient-to-patient variability in immune response as evidenced by the variations in whole protein and epitope-specific antibodies. This cost-effective, rapid, and ultrasensitive plasmonically enhanced multiplexed epitope-specific serological assay has the potential to be broadly employed in the detection of specific antibodies, which may benefit the advanced epidemiology studies and enable improvement of the clinical outcomes and prediction of the future protection against the SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Additionally, ACE2 acts as a receptor for host cell infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that emerged as the cause of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and has brought unprecedented burden to economy and health. ACE2 binds the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and shows little variation in amino acid sequence meaning natural resistance is rare. The discovery of a novel short ACE2 isoform (deltaACE2) provides evidence for inter-individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity, and likelihood of developing subsequent 'Long COVID'. Critically, deltaACE2 loses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding sites in the extracellular domain, and is predicted to confer reduced susceptibility to viral infection. We aimed to assess the differential expression of full-length ACE2 versus deltaACE2 in a panel of human tissues (kidney, heart, lung, and liver) that are implicated in COVID-19, and confirm ACE2 protein in these tissues. Using dual antibody staining, we show that deltaACE2 localises, and is enriched, in lung airway epithelia and bile duct epithelia in the liver. Finally, we also confirm that a fluorescently tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monomer shows low binding at lung and bile duct epithelia where dACE2 is enriched.\",\n",

However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting that boosters enhance the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find Omicron pseudovirus is more infectious than any other variant tested. Overall, this study highlights the importance of boosters to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

The emergence of divergent variants in the context of a heterogeneous and evolving neutralizing antibody response in host populations might compromise protection afforded by vaccines or prior infection.\\nWe measured neutralizing antibody titers in 169 longitudinally collected plasma samples using pseudotypes bearing the Wuhan-hu-1 or the Omicron variant or a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 spike (PMS20). Plasmas were obtained from convalescents who did or did not subsequently receive an mRNA vaccine, or naive individuals who received 3-doses of mRNA or 1-dose Ad26 vaccines. Samples were collected approximately 1, 5-6 and 12 months after initial vaccination or infection.\\nLike PMS20, the Omicron spike protein was substantially resistant to neutralization compared to Wuhan-hu-1. In convalescent plasma the median deficit in neutralizing activity against PMS20 or Omicron was 30- to 60-fold. Plasmas from recipients of 2 mRNA vaccine doses were 30- to 180- fold less potent against PMS20 and Omicron than Wuhan-hu-1. Notably, previously infected or two-mRNA dose vaccinated individuals who received additional mRNA vaccine dose(s) had 38 to 154-fold and 35 to 214-fold increases in neutralizing activity against Omicron and PMS20 respectively.\\nOmicron exhibits similar distribution of sequence changes and neutralization resistance as does a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant spike protein, suggesting natural evolutionary pressure to evade the human antibody response. Currently available mRNA vaccine boosters, that may promote antibody affinity maturation, significantly ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers.',\n",

To aid these studies, based on the wealth of available structural information about several SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and a modeling pipeline we have previously developed for tracking the ongoing global evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we provide a set of computed structural models (henceforth models) of the Omicron VOC receptor-binding domain (omRBD) bound to its corresponding receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE2) and a variety of therapeutic entities, including neutralizing and therapeutic antibodies targeting previously-detected viral strains. We generated bound omRBD models using both experimentally-determined structures in the PDB as well as machine learningbased structure predictions as starting points. Examination of ACE2-bound omRBD models reveals an interdigitated multi-residue interaction network formed by omRBD-specific substituted residues (R493, S496, Y501, R498) and ACE2 residues at the interface, which was not present in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. Emergence of this interaction network suggests optimization of a key region of the binding interface, and positive cooperativity among various sites of residue substitutions in omRBD mediating ACE2 binding. Examination of neutralizing antibody complexes for Barnes Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies modeled with omRBD highlights an overall loss of interfacial interactions (with gain of new interactions in rare cases) mediated by substituted residues. Many of these substitutions have previously been found to independently dampen or even ablate antibody binding, and perhaps mediate antibody-mediated neutralization escape ( ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Kappa and Beta variants with enhanced transmissibility and resistance to neutralizing antibodies has created new challenges for the control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the structural nature of Kappa and Beta spike (S) proteins and their association with ACE2 is of significant importance. Here we present two cryo-EM structures for each of the Kappa and Beta spikes in the open and open-prone transition states. Compared with wild-type (WT) or G614 spikes, the two variant spikes appear more untwisted/open especially for Beta, and display a considerable population shift towards the open state as well as more pronounced conformational dynamics. Moreover, we capture four conformational states of the S-trimer/ACE2 complex for each of the two variants, revealing an enlarged conformational landscape for the Kappa and Beta S-ACE2 complexes and pronounced population shift towards the three RBDs up conformation. These results implicate that the mutations in Kappa and Beta may modify the kinetics of receptor binding and viral fusion to improve virus fitness. Combined with biochemical analysis, our structural study shows that the two variants are enabled to efficiently interact with ACE2 receptor despite their sensitive ACE2 binding surface is modified to escape recognition by some potent neutralizing MAbs. Our findings shed new light on the pathogenicity and immune evasion mechanism of the Beta and Kappa variants.',\n",

Currently, as dangerous mutations emerge, there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The spike glycoprotein on the virus envelope binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells through its receptor binding domain (RBD) to mediate virus entry. Thus, blocking this interaction may inhibit viral entry and consequently stop infection. Here, we generated fusion proteins composed of the extracellular portions of ACE2 and RBD fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (ACE2-Ig and RBD-Ig, respectively). We demonstrate that ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active and that it can be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits in-vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection better than ACE2-Ig. Mechanistically, we show that anti-spike antibody generation, ACE2 enzymatic activity, and ACE2 surface expression were not affected by RBD-Ig. Finally, we show that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig at neutralizing high virus titers. We thus propose that RBD-Ig physically blocks virus infection by binding to ACE2 and that RBD-Ig should be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.',\n",

Taking advantage of detailed epitope mapping, we generate two biparatopic Nbs (bipNbs) targeting a conserved epitope outside and two different epitopes inside the RBD:ACE2 interface.

       "  'abstract': 'Since its onset, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has manifested multiple paradoxes related to both complications of the infection and treatment resistance. The experiences in therapy started from the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and anti-cytokine therapy (anti IL-6, anti-TNF-alpha and CCR5) up to experiments of immunomodulation with glucocorticoids and proposal of very powerful immunomodulatory drugs like cyclophosphamide in optimized diagrams in order to induce the depression of the immune hyperergic reaction with the maintenance of TH and TC lymphocyte resistance to keep the anti-viral activity in the absence of an etiological treatment. In this context, also the second major immunologic mechanism could function: the molecular mimicry - cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and various antigenic determinants from the body, other than the tissue structures of the respiratory system. In a similar manner, in the past, genital staphylococcal infections among women wearing tampons, sometimes generated a toxic-septic shock with an unexpected evolution to death. It is also about an atypical cytokine storm, generated by the staphylococcal toxins (super-antigenic) but probably, the aggressiveness was also generated by the cross reactivity with chemical antigens from the cotton fibers, because this disorder generally appeared among women in the menstrual period, sometimes the local genital infection being minor. Moreover, with the lapse of time, the reaction of shock no longer appeared, probable through the increase of immunologic tolerance to cotton fibers. In a similar manner, in COVID-19 a reaction of hyper-sensitivity to a gaseous antigen could overlap, considering the decrease of tolerance at the invasive administration of oxygen (the contact with BALT - the lymphatic system associated to the bronchia, where the resident macrophage is the siderophage) and partial maintenance at the non-invasive administration through mask or extracorporeal, which induces the first contact with the lymphatic elements associated to the oropharyngeal cavity or blood, where the siderophage can no longer be observed. In this context, some adult patients with COVID-19 could manifest an immunologic genetic defect of TS at BALT level, as women with staphylococcal toxic-septic shock had a local defect at the VALT level (lymphatic tissue associated with the genital tract). In children, the syndrome is rare and more multisystem, which rather suggests the breaking of central tolerance through the lack of intra-thymus or intra-medullary deletion of the auto-reactive clones of (Th TC), while among adults the defect seems to be more peripheral, local, with the involvement of TS and resident macrophages (siderophages). This could explain not only the higher level of severity in elder patients and those with cardiac disorders but also the rarity of the pathology in patients aged under nine years.',\n",

This study analyzes the evolutionary background of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-2) in accordance with its close relative SARS-CoV (SARS-1), which was emerged in 2002. A comparative genomic and proteomic study was conducted on SARS-2, SARS-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which was emerged in 2012. In silico analysis inferred the genetic variability among the tested viruses. The SARS-1 genome harbored 11 genes encoding 12 proteins, while SARS-2 genome contained only 10 genes encoding for 10 proteins. MERS genome contained 11 genes encoding 11 proteins. The analysis also revealed a slight variation in the whole genome size of SARS-2 comparing to its siblings resulting from sequential insertions and deletions (indels) throughout the viral genome particularly ORF1AB, spike, ORF10 and ORF8. The effective indels were observed in the gene encoding the spike protein that is responsible for viral attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and initiating infection. These indels are responsible for the newly emerging COVID-19 variants αCoV, βCoV, γCoV and δCoV. Nowadays, few effective COVID-19 vaccines developed based on spike (S) glycoprotein were approved and become available worldwide. Currently available vaccines can relatively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and suppress the disease. The traditional (killed or attenuated virus vaccine and antibody-based vaccine) and innovated vaccine production technologies (RNA- and DNA-based vaccines and viral vectors) are summarized in this review. We finally highlight the most common questions related to COVID-19 disease and the benefits of getting vaccinated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is well-known that the Coronavirus Disease 2019, which is caused by the beta-coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December 2019 followed by an outbreak first reported in Wuhan, China. Thus far, vaccination appears to be the only way to bring the pandemic to an end. In the present study, immunogenicity data was evaluated using LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (DiaSorin S.p.A) among a sample of 52 vaccinated healthcare workers, five of whom were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 47 who were seronegative, over a time span of ≤90 days following the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The test detects antibodies against the Trimeric complex (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain). The overall mean value of the serum levels of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 30 days following the second dose of the vaccine was 1,901.8 binding arbitrary unit (BAU)/ml, after 60 days the mean value declined to 1,244.9 BAU/ml. The antibody levels then reached a plateau, as confirmed by the antibody test carried out 90 days following the second dose, which revealed a mean value of 1,032.4 BAU/ml (P<0.0001). A higher level was observed at all three times in male subjects compared with female subjects, and in younger male participants compared with female participants, although these differences did not reach a statistically significant level. Similarly, no significant difference was found in antibody values at different times according to age. After the second dose of the vaccine, two subjects were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and an increase in antibody values in the third assay was observed in both individuals.',\n",

Beta is particularly difficult to neutralize using serum induced by early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains and is most antigenically separated from Delta. To understand this, we generated 674 mAbs from Beta-infected individuals and performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the 27 most potent mAbs: one binding the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), the rest the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two of these RBD-binding mAbs recognize a neutralizing epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, while 18 target mutated residues in Beta: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. There is a major response to N501Y, including a public IgVH4-39 sequence, with E484K and K417N also targeted.

The BNT162b2/Pfizer and mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccines represent new vaccine technology relying on administration of mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein encased in lipid nanoparticles. The vaccines are administered as two doses into muscle, which elicits a strong response, typically within 14 days after the second dose. Neuromuscular diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of muscle and are often treated with chronic glucocorticoid steroids, both of which may contribute to a blunted immune response to vaccination. Here, we measured IgG antibody content and neutralizing antibody response after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in non-ambulatory neuromuscular disease patients. After two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, median anti-receptor binding domain IgG and percent surrogate viral neutralization in non-ambulatory neuromuscular disease samples were significantly elevated similar to healthy vaccinated controls. As in healthy controls, COVID-19 vaccines produce greater antibody levels compared to those with a history of outpatient COVID-19 infection. This data documents that non-ambulatory neuromuscular disease patients respond well to two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine despite low muscle mass and even chronic steroid use.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and accurate diagnostic tools that provide quantitative results at the point of care. Real-time RT-PCR requires large laboratories, a skilled workforce, complex and costly equipment, and labor-intensive sample processing. Despite tremendous efforts, scaling up RT-PCR tests is seemingly unattainable. To date, hundreds of millions of COVID-19 tests have been performed globally, but the demand for timely, accurate testing continues to outstrip supply. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing is emerging as an alternative to RT-PCR. However, the performance of these tests, namely their sensitivity, is still inadequate. To overcome the limitations of currently employed diagnostic tests, new tools that are both sensitive and scalable are urgently needed. We have developed a miniaturized electrochemical biosensor based on the integration of specific monoclonal antibodies with a biochip and a measurement platform, and applied it in the detection of Spike S1 protein, the binding protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, quantitative detection of sub-nanomolar concentrations of Spike S1 was demonstrated, exhibiting a broad detection range. To demonstrate the applicability of the biosensor, we have further developed a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus based on Spike protein-pseudo-typed VSV platform. Specific detection of different concentrations of pseudovirus particles was feasible in <30\\xa0min. This new tool may largely contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by enabling intensive testing to be performed and alleviating most of the hurdles that plague current diagnostics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the pandemic occurred due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there has always been a demand for a simple and sensitive diagnostic kit for detection of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In January 2020, WHO approved the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the presence of Covid-19 genetic material in individuals. Till date many diagnostic kits have arrived in the market for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In spite of being the gold standard method of Covid-19 detection, there are some drawbacks associated with RT-PCR which leads to false-negative results. Hence, in order to fulfil the need for an antibody testing kit for evaluating seroconversion and immunity acquisition in the population, an efficient, highly specific and sensitive assay, Chimera Soochak, an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) Kit has been developed. It works on the principle of detecting IgG antibodies developed specifically against the S1-RBD by employing a recombinant strain of S1-RBD produced in the HEK293 cell line. The developed kit was validated using different modes and methods to attain the utmost confidence on the samples collected from patients. The validation methodology included, validation with known samples, blind study, third-party validation, validation using WHO Reference Panel and comparison with FDA approved Surrogate virus neutralization kit. The kit was found successful in detecting IgG against the S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The kit had been validated on multiple parameters. A total of 900 samples had been tested by using this kit and it has exhibited the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for all the above-mentioned parameters.',\n",

The ability of the VNARs to neutralize pseudotype and authentic live SARS-CoV-2 virus rivalled or exceeded that of full-length immunoglobulins and other single-domain antibodies.

Of note, COVID-19+ women deliver earlier than COVID-19- women, and the risk for severe neonatal and perinatal morbidity and mortality is significantly higher. The probability and pathways of vertical transmission of the virus from the pregnant woman to the fetus are highly controversial. Recent data have shown that 54 (13%) of 416 neonates born to COVID-19-positive women were infected. Here, we investigated term placentas collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and studied the main COVID-19 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, as well as NRP1. We performed qPCR and immunofluorescence on cryosections in combination with markers for syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, macrophages and stromal cells. The qPCR studies showed expression of both the truncated delta form of ACE2, which does not bind the COVID-19 spike protein, and the long form. The ACE2 antibody used does not distinguish between the two forms. We did not observe expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery on syncytio- and cytotrophoblast. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a subpopulation of stromal cells, which in part are CD68-positive macrophages. NRP1 is localized to endothelial cells. In sum, the term placenta is not an organ that directly favors vertical transmission of COVID-19, however, microtraumas and placentitis may weaken its barrier function.',\n",

The N501Y RBD mutant binds to ACE2 with higher affinity due to improved π-π stacking and π-cation interactions. The higher binding affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of additional hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interactions with ACE2. Both the mutants bind to the B38 antibody with reduced affinity due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions. The insights obtained from the study are crucial to interpret the increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization efficacy of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV2 VOCs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As the second wave of COVID-19 launched, various variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged with a dramatic global spread amongst millions of people causing unprecedented case fatalities and economic shut-downs. That initiated a necessity for developing specific diagnostics and therapeutics along with vaccines to control such a pandemic. This endeavor describes generation of murine derived recombinant single-chain fragment variable (scFv) as a monoclonal antibody (MAb) platform targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A specific synthesized RBD coding sequence was cloned and expressed in Baculovirus expression system. The recombinant RBD (rRBD) was ascertained to be at the proper encoding size of ∼ 600bp and expressed protein of the molecular weight of ∼ 21KDa. Purified rRBD was proved genuinely antigenic and immunogenic, exhibiting specific reactivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and inducing strong seroconversion in immunized mice. The scFv phage display library against rRBD was successfully constructed, revealing ∼ 90 % recombination frequency, and great enriching factor reaching 88 % and 25 % in polyclonal Ab-based and MAb-based ELISAs, respectively. Typically, three unique scFvs were generated, selected, purified and molecularly identified. That was manifested by their: accurate structure, close relation to the mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, right anchored six complementarily-determining regions (CDRs) as three within variable heavy (vH) and variable light (vL) regions each, and proper configuration of the three-dimensional (3D) structure. Besides, their expression downstream in a non-suppressive amber codon of E. coli strain SS32 created a distinct protein band at an apparent molecular weight of ∼ 27KDa. Moreover, the purified scFvs showed authentic immunoreactivity and specificity to both rRBD and SARS-CoV-2 in western blot and ELISA. Accordingly, these developed scFvs platform might be a functional candidate for research, inexpensive diagnostics and therapeutics, mitigating spread of COVID-19.',\n",

We have used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based prime-boost immunization strategy to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine candidate. We have constructed VSV genomes carrying exogenous genes resulting in the production of avirulent rVSV carrying the full-length spike protein (SF), the S1 subunit, or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) plus envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Adding the honeybee melittin signal peptide (msp) to the N-terminus enhanced the protein expression, and adding the VSV G protein transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (Gtc) enhanced protein incorporation into pseudotype VSV. All rVSVs expressed three different forms of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, but chimeras with VSV-Gtc demonstrated the highest rVSV-associated expression. In immunized mice, rVSV with chimeric S protein-Gtc derivatives induced the highest level of potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, and rVSV harboring the full-length msp-SF-Gtc proved to be the superior immunogen. More importantly, rVSV-msp-SF-Gtc vaccinated animals were completely protected from a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, we have developed an efficient strategy to induce a protective response in SARS-CoV-2 challenged immunized mice.

Two vaccine types were developed using two different technologies: viral vectors and mRNA. Thrombosis is one of the most severe and atypical adverse effects of vaccines. This study aimed to analyze published cases of thrombosis after COVID-19 vaccinations to identify patients' features, potential pathophysiological mechanisms, timing of appearance of the adverse events, and other critical issues.\\nWe performed a systematic electronic search of scientific articles regarding COVID-19 vaccine-related thrombosis and its complications on the PubMed (MEDLINE) database and through manual searches. We selected 10 out of 50 articles from February 1 to May 5, 2021 and performed a descriptive analysis of the adverse events caused by the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the adenovirus-based AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nIn the articles on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the sample consisted of three male patients with age heterogeneity. The time from vaccination to admission was ≤3 days in all cases; all patients presented signs of petechiae/purpura at admission, with a low platelet count. In the studies on the AstraZeneca vaccine, the sample consisted of 58 individuals with a high age heterogeneity and a high female prevalence. Symptoms appeared around the ninth day, and headache was the most common symptom. The platelet count was below the lower limit of the normal range. All patients except one were positive for PF4 antibodies. The cerebral venous sinus was the most affected site. Death was the most prevalent outcome in all studies, except for one study in which most of the patients remained alive.\\nVaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is an unknown nosological phenomenon secondary to inoculation with the COVID-19 vaccine. Several hypotheses have been formulated regarding its physiopathological mechanism. Recent studies have assumed a mechanism that is assimilable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with protagonist antibodies against the PF4-polyanion complex. Viral DNA has a negative charge and can bind to PF4, causing VITT. New experimental studies have assumed that thrombosis is related to a soluble adenoviral protein spike variant, originating from splicing events, which cause important endothelial inflammatory events, and binding to endothelial cells expressing ACE2.\\nFurther studies are needed to better identify VITT's pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic, demographic, or clinical predisposition of high-risk patients, to investigate the correlation of VITT with the different vaccine types, and to test the significance of the findings.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Macaques are a commonly used model for studying immunity to human viruses, including for studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. However, it is unknown whether macaque antibody responses recapitulate, and thus appropriately model, the response in humans. To answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach (Phage- DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in humans and macaques following either vaccination or infection. We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix- heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited. Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques.\\nNon-human primates, including macaques, are considered the best animal model for studying infectious diseases that infect humans. Vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 are first tested in macaques to assess immune responses prior to advancing to human trials, and macaques are also used to model the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there may be differences in how macaque and human antibodies recognize the SARS-CoV-2 entry protein, Spike. Here we characterized the locations on Spike that are recognized by antibodies from vaccinated or infected macaques and humans. We also made mutations to the viral sequence and assessed how these affected antibody binding, enabling a comparison of antibody binding requirements between macaques and humans at a very precise level. We found that macaques and humans share some responses, but also recognize distinct regions of Spike. We also found that in general, antibodies from different individuals had unique responses to viral mutations, regardless of species. These results will yield a better understanding of how macaque data can be used to inform human immunity to SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC, and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time.\\nThe newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses, in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8+ T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron. These data suggest that the T-cell immune response in previously infected, and most likely vaccinated individuals, should still be effective against Omicron.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A key goal of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is to rapidly identify viral variants with mutations that reduce neutralization by polyclonal antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection. Unfortunately, direct experimental characterization of new viral variants lags their sequence-based identification. Here we help address this challenge by aggregating deep mutational scanning data into an \"escape calculator\" that estimates the antigenic effects of arbitrary combinations of mutations to the virus\\'s spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). The calculator can be used to intuitively visualize how mutations impact polyclonal antibody recognition, and score the expected antigenic effect of combinations of mutations. These scores correlate with neutralization assays performed on SARS-CoV-2 variants, and emphasize the ominous antigenic properties of the recently described Omicron variant. An interactive version of the calculator is at https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2_RBD_Ab_escape_maps/escape-calc/ , and we provide a Python module for batch processing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'On December 31, 2019; unidentified pneumonia cases were reported from China. It was soon announced that these cases were of viral origin and the cause was a new coronavirus (CoV). Initially, the virus was called \"novel CoV \" and then defined as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\" after more detailed investigations. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. The rapid spread of the disease in a few months has resulted in a global pandemic and it continues. However, there are no specific effective anti-viral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infection, some antiviral drugs are using in the therapy of COVID-19 with limited success. Currently, for the prevention of the pandemic, global vaccination seems to be important. Antiviral protection of vaccines is provided by the development of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Antibody response develops against spike protein and nucleocapsid protein but neutralizing antibodies are formed against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. It has also been shown that most viral proteins are recognized in T-cell responses. Vaccine discovery trials for COVID-19 have begun all over the world since the outbreak began. More than 100 vaccine studies against COVID-19 have been published in the last year. Some of them were urgently approved and used worldwide. The current study aimed to review the progression and current use of COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"One of the proven methods to prevent and inhibit viral infections is to use antibodies to block the initial Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and avoid its binding with the host cells. Thus, developing these RBD-targeting antibodies would be a promising approach for treating the SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease and stop virus replication. Macrocyclic epitopes constitute closer mimics of the receptor's actual topology and, as such, are expected to be superior epitopes for antibody generation. This work demonstrated the vital effect of the three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the developed antibodies' activity against RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater stability of the cyclic epitopes in comparison with the linear counterpart, which was reflected in the activity of their produced antibodies. Indeed, the antibodies we developed using macrocyclic epitopes showed superiority with respect to binding to RBD proteins compared to antibodies formed from a linear peptide. The results of the present work constitute a roadmap for developing superior antibodies that could be used to inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 and prevent its reproduction.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike protein (S) has been verified to be the main target for potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in most coronaviruses, and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of some betacoronaviruses has also been indicated to induce nAbs. For alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E, its RBD has been shown to have neutralizing epitopes, and these epitopes could change over time. However, whether neutralizing epitopes exist on the NTD and whether these epitopes change like those of the RBD are still unknown. Here, we verified that neutralizing epitopes exist on the NTD of HCoV-229E. Furthermore, we characterized an NTD targeting nAb 5H10, which could neutralize both pseudotyped and authentic HCoV-229E VR740 in vitro. Epitope mapping indicated that 5H10 targeted motif E1 (147-167 aa) and identified F159 as critical for 5H10 binding. More importantly, our results revealed that motif E1 was highly conserved among clinical isolates except for F159. Further data proved that mutations at position 159 gradually appeared over time and could completely abolish the neutralizing ability of 5H10, supporting the notion that position 159 may be under selective pressure during the human epidemic. In addition, we also found that contemporary clinical serum has a stronger binding capacity for the NTD of contemporary strains than historic strains, proving that the epitope on the NTD could change over time. In summary, these findings define a novel neutralizing epitope on the NTD of HCoV-229E S and provide a theoretical basis for the design of vaccines against HCoV-229E or related coronaviruses. ',\n",

These mutations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, virulence, or resistance to some neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the accurate detection of spike mutants is crucial for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and identifying neutralizing antibody-resistance caused by amino acid changes in the receptor-binding domain. Here, we developed five SARS-CoV-2 spike gene primer pairs (5-SSG primer assay; 69S, 144S, 417S, 484S, and 570S) and verified their ability to detect nine key spike mutations (ΔH69/V70, T95I, G142D, ΔY144, K417T/N, L452R, E484K/Q, N501Y, and H655Y) using a Sanger sequencing-based assay. The 5-SSG primer assay showed 100% specificity and a conservative limit of detection with a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) values of 1.4 × 102 TCID50/mL. The accuracy of the 5-SSG primer assay was confirmed by next generation sequencing. The results of these two approaches showed 100% consistency. Taken together, the ability of the 5-SSG primer assay to accurately detect key SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants is reliable. Thus, it is a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike gene mutants in a clinical setting, thereby helping to improve the management of patients with COVID-19.',\n",

Compared with the last VOC (Delta variant), more mutations were identified, which may address the characteristics of Omicron. Considering these crucial mutations and their implications including an increase in transmissibility, COVID-19 severity, and reduction of efficacy of currently available diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, Omicron has been classified as one of the VOC. Notably, 15 of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein, which may alter transmissibility, infectivity, neutralizing antibody escape, and vaccine breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Therefore, our present study characterizes the mutational hotspots of the Omicron variant in comparison with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed information was analyzed to characterize the global perspective of Omicron, including transmission dynamic, effect on testing, and immunity, which shall promote the progress of the clinical application and basic research. Collectively, our data suggest that due to continuous variation in the spike glycoprotein sequences, the use of coronavirus-specific attachment inhibitors may not be the current choice of therapy for emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Hence, we need to proceed with a sense of urgency in this matter.',\n",

Two loop-like epitopes with lengths of 22 and 42 amino acid residues were selected from the receptor-binding motif of the Spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that participate in a large number of protein-protein interactions in the complexes with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies. Two types of hybrid proteins, including one of the two selected epitopes, were constructed. To fix conformation of the selected epitopes, an approach using protein scaffolds was used. The homologue of Rop protein from the Escherichia coli ColE1 plasmid containing helix-turn-helix motif was used as an epitope scaffold for the convergence of C- and N-termini of the loop-like epitopes. Loop epitopes were inserted into the turn region. The conformation was additionally fixed by a disulfide bond formed between the cysteine residues present within the epitopes.

These data show that convalescent patients maintain functional antibody responses for more than one year after infection, suggesting a strong long-lasting response after symptomatic disease that may offer a prolonged protection against re-infection. One patient from this cohort showed strong increase of both Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies at 14 months post-infection indicating SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. These antibodies showed stronger cross-reactivity to a panel of Spike-RBD including Beta, Delta and Mu and neutralization of a panel of Spike variants including Beta and Gamma. This patient provides an example of strong anti-Spike recall immunity able to control infection at an asymptomatic level. Together, the antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients persist over 14 months and continue to maintain cross-reactivity to the current variants of concern and show strong functional properties.',\n",

While there are various reports of factors associated with immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, little is known about those of adenovirus vector vaccines. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the relationships of antibody level with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and adverse reactions (ARs) to an adenovirus vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Healthcare workers who planned to receive both the first and second injections of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at Hanyang University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, were enrolled in the study. Seven days after each injection, participants were asked to complete an online adverse reaction survey. In addition, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody concentration was measured 4 weeks after the second injection. All participants (n = 447, 100%) showed serologic positivity (≥ 0.8 U/mL) 4 weeks after the second injection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Furthermore, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD concentration was similar among groups when stratified by age, sex, BMI, or presence and severity of AR; multivariable linear regression found no associations between antibody response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and age, BMI, sex, and vaccine-induced ARs. In conclusion, age, sex, obesity, and ARs were not associated with antibody responses after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.',\n",

Sequence-based clonal clustering can identify antibodies with similar epitope complementarity, however, antibodies from markedly different lineages but with similar structures can engage the same epitope. We describe a novel computational method for epitope profiling based on structural modelling and clustering. Using the method, we demonstrate that sequence dissimilar but functionally similar antibodies can be found across the Coronavirus Antibody Database, with high accuracy (92% of antibodies in multiple-occupancy structural clusters bind to consistent domains). Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than is suggested by sequence-based approaches. Our results show that applying structural analytics to large class-specific antibody databases will enable high confidence structure-function relationships to be drawn, yielding new opportunities to identify functional convergence hitherto missed by sequence-only analysis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The evolution of circulating viruses is shaped by their need to evade antibody response, which mainly targets the viral spike. Because of the high density of spikes on the viral surface, not all antigenic sites are targeted equally by antibodies. We offer here a geometry-based approach to predict and rank the probability of surface residues of SARS spike (S protein) and influenza H1N1 spike (hemagglutinin) to acquire antibody-escaping mutations utilizing in-silico models of viral structure. We used coarse-grained MD simulations to estimate the on-rate (targeting) of an antibody model to surface residues of the spike protein. Analyzing publicly available sequences, we found that spike surface sequence diversity of the pre-pandemic seasonal influenza H1N1 and the sarbecovirus subgenus highly correlates with our model prediction of antibody targeting. In particular, we identified an antibody-targeting gradient, which matches a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike. This identifies the role of viral surface geometry in shaping the evolution of circulating viruses. For the 2009 H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike was not observed. Our model further allowed us to identify key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike at which antibody escape mutations have now occurred. Therefore, it can inform of the likely functional role of observed mutations and predict at which residues antibody-escaping mutation might arise.',\n",

Moreover, the impact of these variants on infectivity and response to neutralizing antibodies has been assessed. In the present study, we retrieved a total number of 176 complete and high-quality S glycoprotein sequences of Iranian SARS-COV-2 in public database of the GISAID and GenBank from April 2020 up to May 2021. Then, we identified the number of variables, singleton and parsimony informative sites at both gene and protein levels and discussed the possible functional consequences of important mutations on the infectivity and response to neutralizing antibodies. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to represent the relationship between Iranian SARS-COV2 and variants of concern (VOC), variants of interest (VOI) and reference sequence. We found that the four current VOCs - Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta - are circulated in different regions in Iran. The Delta variant is notably more transmissible than other variants, and is expected to become a dominant variant. However, some of the Delta variants in Iran carry an additional mutation, namely E1202Q in the HR2 subdomain that might confer an advantage to viral/cell membrane fusion process. We also observed some more common mutations such as an N-terminal domain (NTD) deletion at position I210 and P863H in fusion peptide-heptad repeat 1 span region in Iranian SARS-COV-2.

The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies among 7,252 HCWs was 85.2% (95% CI 83.5% to 86.7%). Important limitations of the study include the survey design, which was aimed to estimate seroprevalence at the national level and not at a sub-national level, and the non-participation of 19% of eligible individuals in the survey.\\nNearly two-thirds of individuals aged ≥6 years from the general population and 85% of HCWs had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by June-July 2021 in India. As one-third of the population is still seronegative, it is necessary to accelerate the coverage of COVID-19 vaccination among adults and continue adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions.',\n",

For the micro-neutralization assay, 19 serum samples, with positive IgG titers against Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) were tested. After 24 hours, infected cells were inspected for the presence of a cytopathic effect, lysed and RNA RT-PCR conducted for SARS-CoV-2. PCR target Ct values were used to calculate percent neutralization/inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.\\nOut of 19 samples, 13 samples gave 100% neutralization at all dilutions, 1 sample showed neutralization at the first dilution, 4 samples showed neutralization at lower dilutions, while one sample did not demonstrate any neutralization. The RBD ODs and neutralization potential percentages were found to be positively correlated.\\nWe describe a rapid RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies.

These variants have raised concerns whether pre-existing immunity to vaccination or prior infection would be able to protect against the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or not. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-confirmed patients in the beginning of the first (April/May 2020) and second (April/May 2021) waves of COVID-19 in India (Hisar, Haryana). Upon complete nucleotide sequencing, the viruses were found to be genetically related with wild-type (WT) and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 produced a rapid cytopathic effect (24-36 h as compared to 48-72 h in WT) and had bigger plaque size but a shorter life cycle (~6 h as compared to the ~8 h in WT). Furthermore, the Delta variant achieved peak viral titers within 24 h as compared to the 48 h in WT. These evidence suggested that the Delta variant replicates significantly faster than the WT SARS-CoV-2. The virus neutralization experiments indicated that antibodies elicited by vaccination are more efficacious in neutralizing the WT virus but significantly less potent against the Delta variant. Our findings have implications in devising suitable vaccination, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, besides providing insights into understanding virus replication and transmission.',\n",

It is the most challenging pandemic of this century. The growing COVID-19 pandemic has triggered extraordinary efforts to restrict the virus in numerous ways, owing to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Immunotherapy, which includes artificially stimulating the immune system to generate an immunological response, is regarded as an effective strategy for preventing and treating several infectious illnesses and malignancies. Given the pandemic's high fatality rate and quick expansion, an effective vaccination is urgently needed to keep it under control. The basic goal of all COVID-19 vaccine programs is to develop a vaccine that causes the generation of surface protein neutralizing antibodies in subjects. The epitope discovery for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates is likewise made using an immuno-informatics methodology. It can be used to find the epitopes in viral proteins important for cytotoxic T cells and B cells. A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine that can elicit the necessary immune response is necessary to end the epidemic. The global search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is yielding results. More than a dozen vaccines have already been approved around the world, with many more in the clinical trials. Patents can cover the underlying technology used to generate a vaccine, whereas trade secrets can cover manufacturing methods and procedures.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which constitute about 5-10% of CD4+T cells expressing Foxp3 transcription factor and CD25(IL-2 receptor α chain), are key regulators in controlling immunological self-tolerance and various immune responses. However, how Treg cells control antigen-specific immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of transient breakdown of the immunological tolerance induced by Treg-cell depletion on adaptive immune responses against administered SARS-CoV-2 antigen, spike protein 1 (S1). Notably, without the use of adjuvants, transient Treg-cell depletion in mice induced anti-S1 antibodies that neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2, follicular helper T cell formation and S1-binding germinal center B cell responses, but prevented the onset of developing autoimmune diseases. To further clarify the mechanisms, we investigated maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which is essential to initiate antigen-specific immunity. We found that the transient Treg-cell depletion resulted in maturation of both migratory and resident DCs in draining lymph nodes that captured S1-antigen. Moreover, we observed S1-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells with interferon-γ production. Thus, captured S1 was successfully presented by DCs, including cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. These data indicate that transient Treg-cell depletion in the absence of adjuvants induces maturation of antigen-presenting DCs and succeeds in generating antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Finally, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific immune responses induced by transient Treg-cell depletion in the absence of adjuvants were compatible with those induced with an effective adjuvant, polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidyl acid (poly IC) and that the combination of transient Treg-cell depletion with poly IC induced potent responses. These findings highlight the capacity for manipulating Treg cells to induce protective adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with activating antigen-presenting DCs, which may improve the efficacy of ongoing vaccine therapies and help enhance responses to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

However, there is a critical lack of data on the dynamics of vaccine responses in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) undergoing immunosuppressive/disease modifying anti-rheumatic (DMARD) treatment. Here, we present the first data regarding the decline of the vaccine-induced humoral immune responses in patients with CID.\\n23 patients with CID were monitored clinically and for anti-spike IgG and IgA levels, neutralization efficacy and antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses over the first 6 months after SARS-CoV2 vaccination. 24 healthy individuals were included as controls.\\nWhile anti-spike IgG-levels declined in CID patients and healthy controls, patients receiving anti-TNF treatment showed significantly greater declines at 6 months post second vaccination in IgG and especially neutralizing antibodies. IgA levels were generally lower in CID patients, particularly during anti-TNF therapy. No differences in SARS-CoV2 spike-specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies were detected.\\nAlthough the long-term efficacy of SARS-CoV2 vaccination in CID patients undergoing disease-modifying therapy is still not known, the pronounced declines in humoral responses towards SARS-CoV2 6 months after mRNA vaccination in the context of TNF blockade should be considered when formulating booster regimens. These patients should be considered for early booster vaccinations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A comprehensive study of the B cell response against SARS-CoV-2 could be significant for understanding the immune response and developing therapeutical antibodies and vaccines. To define the dynamics and characteristics of the antibody repertoire following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the mRNA transcripts of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) repertoires of 24 peripheral blood samples collected between 3 and 111 days after symptom onset from 10 COVID-19 patients. Massive clonal expansion of naïve B cells with limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) was observed in the second week after symptom onset. The proportion of low-SHM IgG clones strongly correlated with spike-specific IgG antibody titers, highlighting the significant activation of naïve B cells in response to a novel virus infection. The antibody isotype switching landscape showed a transient IgA surge in the first week after symptom onset, followed by a sustained IgG elevation that lasted for at least 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited poly-germline reactive antibody responses. Interestingly, 17 different IGHV germline genes recombined with IGHJ6 showed significant clonal expansion. By comparing the IgH repertoires that we sequenced with the 774 reported SARS-CoV-2-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 13 shared spike-specific IgH clusters were found. These shared spike-specific IgH clusters are derived from the same lineage of several recently published neutralizing mAbs, including CC12.1, CC12.3, C102, REGN10977, and 4A8. Furthermore, identical spike-specific IgH sequences were found in different COVID-19 patients, suggesting a highly convergent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis based on sequencing antibody repertoires from different individuals revealed key signatures of the systemic B cell response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. ',\n",

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. Here, we demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain, which occurred in co-mutations Y449S and N501Y, has reduced infectivity compared to that of the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracking the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in more than 2.2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations, like those in Omicron, will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is either vaccinated or infected. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.\",\n",

Although we found that the concentration of anti-spike IgA in breastmilk might not be sufficient to directly neutralize SARS-CoV-2, our data suggest that cumulative transfer of IgA might provide the infant with effective neutralization capacity. Our findings put forward the possibility that breastmilk might convey both immediate (through anti-spike SIgA) and long-lived (via spike-reactive T\\xa0cells) immune protection to the infant. Further studies are needed to address this possibility and to determine the functional profile of spike T\\xa0cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine-breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may be twice more likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However, its impact on Regeneron mAb cocktail appears to be mild.\",\n",

This will benefit from the ability to measure antibody-based protection to SARS-CoV-2, ideally with rapid turnaround and without the need for laboratory-based testing.\\nWe have developed a lateral flow POC test that can measure levels of RBD-ACE2 neutralising antibody (NAb) from whole blood, with a result that can be determined by eye or quantitatively on a small instrument. We compared our lateral flow test with the gold-standard microneutralisation assay, using samples from convalescent and vaccinated donors, as well as immunised macaques.\\nWe show a high correlation between our lateral flow test with conventional neutralisation and that this test is applicable with animal samples. We also show that this assay is readily adaptable to test for protection to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the beta variant which revealed a marked reduction in NAb activity. Lastly, using a cohort of vaccinated humans, we demonstrate that our whole-blood test correlates closely with microneutralisation assay data (specificity 100% and sensitivity 96% at a microneutralisation cutoff of 1:40) and that fingerprick whole blood samples are sufficient for this test.\\nTaken together, the COVID-19 NAb-test\\nSupport was received from the Victorian Operational Infrastructure Support Program and the Australian Government Department of Health.

Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are thought to be a primary immune defense against the virus. Large, diverse, well-characterized cohorts of convalescent individuals provide standardized values to benchmark nAb responses to past SARS-CoV-2 infection and define potentially protective levels of immunity.\\nThis analysis comprises an observational cohort of 329 HIV-seronegative adults in the United States (n = 167) and Peru (n = 162) convalescing from SARS-CoV-2 infection from May through October 2020. The mean age was 48 years (range 18 to 86), 54% of the cohort overall was Hispanic, and 34% identified as White. nAb titers were measured in serum by SARS-CoV-2.D614G Spike-pseudotyped virus infection of 293T/ACE2 cells. Multiple linear regression was applied to define associations between nAb titers and demographic variables, disease severity and time from infection or disease onset, and comorbidities within and across US and Peruvian cohorts over time. nAb titers peaked 28 to 42 days post-diagnosis and were higher in participants with a history of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (p < 0.001). Diabetes, age >55 years, male sex assigned at birth, and, in some cases, body mass index were also independently associated with higher nAb titers, whereas hypertension was independently associated with lower nAb titers. nAb titers did not differ by race, underlying pulmonary disease or smoking. Two months post-enrollment, nAb ID50 (ID80) titers declined 3.5 (2.8)-fold overall. Study limitations in this observational, convalescent cohort include survivorship bias and missing early viral loads and acute immune responses to correlate with the convalescent responses we observed.\\nIn summary, in our cohort, nAb titers after SARS-CoV-2 infection peaked approximately 1 month post-diagnosis and varied by age, sex assigned at birth, disease severity, and underlying comorbidities. Our data show great heterogeneity in nAb responses among people with recent COVID-19, highlighting the challenges of interpreting natural history studies and gauging responses to vaccines and therapeutics among people with recent infection. Our observations illuminate potential correlations of demographic and clinical characteristics with nAb responses, a key element for protection from COVID-19, thus informing development and implementation of preventative and therapeutic strategies globally.\\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04403880.',\n",

Importantly, particular subgroups are more prone to severe disease, namely patients with poor immune responses. This includes cancer patients with solid and haematological disease, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients and those with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. Outcomes for patients with poor immune responses receiving antibody therapy for underlying disease and SARS-CoV-2 severe infection are undergoing investigation. The objective of this study was to perform a search on patients with poor immune responses with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, to assess if antibody therapy is beneficial in such populations. We performed searches using PubMED and medrXiv up to May 2021 of patients with solid and hematologic malignancy, SOT patients and acquired or congenital immunodeficiency. The primary outcome was to assess if antibody therapy was included during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes of such treatment in this population. Here we find that there is a repurposing of monoclonal antibodies to target cytokine release syndrome, along with the use of convalescent plasma (CP). Despite CP demonstrating promising results, we reiterate evidence that CP forces mutational escape and subsequent variant development. Repurposing of antibody therapies (such as Tocilizumab) proved effective, especially in SOT patients. This also potentially opens an avenue for the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; however, studies have yet to focus on patients with poor immune responses as a subpopulation.',\n",

SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) plays fundamental roles related to cell infection. Antibodies could be developed to target RBD and represent a potential approach for the neutralization of the virus. Epitopes used to produce antibodies are generally linear peptides and thus possess multiple confirmations that do not reflect the actual topology of the targeted part in the native protein. On the other hand, macrocyclic epitopes could constitute closer mimics of the native protein topology and, as such, could generate superior antibodies. In this study, we demonstrated the vital effect of the size and the three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the activity of the developed antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater stability of the cyclic epitopes compared with the linear counterparts, which was reflected in the affinity of the produced antibodies. The antibodies developed using macrocyclic epitopes showed superiority with respect to binding to RBD compared to antibodies formed from linear peptides.

Second generation vaccines that are universally affordable and induce systemic and mucosal immunity are needed. Here we performed an extended safety and immunogenicity analysis of a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine consisting of a live Newcastle disease virus vector expressing a pre-fusion stabilized version of the spike protein (NDV-HXP-S) administered intranasally (IN), intramuscularly (IM), or IN followed by IM in Sprague Dawley rats. Local reactogenicity, systemic toxicity, and post-mortem histopathology were assessed after the vaccine administration, with no indication of severe local or systemic reactions. Immunogenicity studies showed that the three vaccination regimens tested elicited high antibody titers against the wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the NDV vector. Moreover, high antibody titers were induced against the spike of B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of concern (VOCs). Importantly, robust levels of serum antibodies with neutralizing activity against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate were detected after the boost. Overall, our study expands the pre-clinical safety and immunogenicity characterization of NDV-HXP-S and reinforces previous findings in other animal models about its high immunogenicity.

       "  'abstract': 'Amino acid substitutions and deletions in the Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants can reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In contrast, heterologous polyclonal antibodies raised against S protein, through the recognition of multiple target epitopes, have the potential to maintain neutralization capacities. XAV-19 is a swine glyco-humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibody raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. XAV-19 target epitopes were found distributed all over the RBD and particularly cover the receptor binding motives (RBMs), in direct contact sites with the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Therefore, in Spike/ACE-2 interaction assays, XAV-19 showed potent neutralization capacities of the original Wuhan Spike and of the United Kingdom (Alpha/B.1.1.7) and South African (Beta/B.1.351) variants. These results were confirmed by cytopathogenic assays using Vero E6 and live virus variants including the Brazil (Gamma/P.1) and the Indian (Delta/B.1.617.2) variants. In a selective pressure study on Vero E6 cells conducted over 1 month, no mutation was associated with the addition of increasing doses of XAV-19. The potential to reduce viral load in lungs was confirmed in a human ACE-2 transduced mouse model. XAV-19 is currently evaluated in patients hospitalized for COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia in phase 2a-2b (NCT04453384) where safety was already demonstrated and in an ongoing 2/3 trial (NCT04928430) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XAV-19 in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Owing to its polyclonal nature and its glyco-humanization, XAV-19 may provide a novel safe and effective therapeutic tool to mitigate the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including the different variants of concern identified so far.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Infection of human cells by pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, typically proceeds by cell surface binding to a crucial receptor. The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), yet new studies reveal the importance of additional extracellular co-receptors that mediate binding and host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types, where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens' cellular uptake. Biophysical and cell infection studies are done to determine whether vimentin might bind SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate its uptake. Dynamic light scattering shows that vimentin binds to pseudovirus coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and antibodies against vimentin block in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-expressing cells. The results are consistent with a model in which extracellular vimentin acts as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a binding affinity less than that of the spike protein with ACE2. Extracellular vimentin may thus serve as a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex in mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and vimentin-targeting agents may yield new therapeutic strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 infection.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Numerous vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, are under development. The majority of vaccine candidates to date are designed to induce immune responses against the viral spike (S) protein, although different forms of S antigen have been incorporated. To evaluate the yield and immunogenicity of different forms of S, we constructed modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing full-length S (MVA-S), the RBD, and soluble S ectodomain and tested their immunogenicity in dose-ranging studies in mice. All three MVA vectors induced spike-specific immunoglobulin G after one subcutaneous immunization and serum titers were boosted following a second immunization. The MVA-S and MVA-ssM elicited the strongest neutralizing antibody responses. In assessing protective efficacy, MVA-S-immunized adult Syrian hamsters were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (USA/WA1/2020). MVA-S-vaccinated hamsters exhibited less severe manifestations of atypical pneumocyte hyperplasia, hemorrhage, vasculitis, and especially consolidation, compared to control animals. They also displayed significant reductions in gross pathology scores and weight loss, and a moderate reduction in virus shedding was observed post challenge in nasal washes. There was evidence of reduced viral replication by in situ hybridization, although the reduction in viral RNA levels in lungs and nasal turbinates did not reach significance. Taken together, the data indicate that immunization with two doses of an MVA vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S provides protection against a stringent SARS-CoV-2 challenge of adult Syrian hamsters, reaffirm the utility of this animal model for evaluating candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and demonstrate the value of an MVA platform in facilitating vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible of the current pandemic ongoing all around the world. Since its discovery in 2019, several circulating variants have emerged and some of them are associated with increased infections and death rate. Despite the genetic differences among these variants, vaccines approved for human use have shown a good immunogenic and protective response against them. In Chile, over 70% of the vaccinated population is immunized with CoronaVac, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The immune response elicited by this vaccine has been described against the first SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from Wuhan, China and the D614G strain (lineage B). To date, four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern described have circulated worldwide. Here, we describe the neutralizing capacities of antibodies secreted by volunteers in the Chilean population immunized with CoronaVac against variants of concern Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.617.2).\\nVolunteers enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial were vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac in 0-14 or 0-28 immunization schedules. Sera samples were used to evaluate the capacity of antibodies induced by the vaccine to block the binding between Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from variants of concern and the human ACE2 receptor by an in-house ELISA. Further, conventional microneutralization assays were used to test neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, interferon-γ-secreting T cells against Spike from variants of concern were evaluated in PBMCs from vaccinated subjects using ELISPOT.\\nCoronaVac promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block the RBD of all the SARS-CoV-2 variants studied. Seropositivity rates of neutralizing antibodies in the population evaluated were over 97% for the lineage B strain, over 80% for Alpha and Gamma variants, over 75% for Delta variant and over 60% for the Beta variant. Geometric means titers of blocking antibodies were reduced when tested against SARS-CoV-2 variants as compared to ancestral strain. We also observed that antibodies from vaccinated subjects were able to neutralize the infection of variants D614G, Alpha, Gamma and Delta in a conventional microneutralization assay. Importantly, after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed that the blocking capacity of antibodies from vaccinated volunteers increased up to ten times for all the variants tested. We compared the number of interferon-γ-secreting T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 Spike WT and variants of concern from vaccinated subjects and we did not detect significant differences.\\nImmunization with CoronaVac in either immunization schedule promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and partially neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it stimulates cellular responses against all variants of concern.',\n",

For vaccine development, S protein on viral envelope that binds to ACE2 receptor on cells for entry was identified as vaccine candidate. S protein consists of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in the S1 subunit followed by the S2 subunit with an intermediate furin cleavage site. A stabilized version of S protein with 2 proline residues was used as antigen. Overall, most vaccines exhibited efficacy between 80 and 95%. However, being a RNA virus that is prone to mutations along with selection pressure on S protein and frequent use of convalescent plasma led to evolution of variants. These variants are responsible for multiple waves of infection observed globally. In our review, we discuss current data on vaccines and its efficacy in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan and its variants. Further, our docked mutations observed in variants on the ACE2-S complex cryo-EM structure show that mostly the S1 domain is under selection pressure where major mutations occur in the N terminal domain (NTD), RBM and junction near S1-S2 subunit. Therefore, this review would be a reference for development of new candidate antigen(s) with better efficacy against variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2, the protein that enables the virus to infect human cells, is the basis for many vaccines and a hotspot of concerning virus evolution. Here, we discuss the outstanding progress in structural characterization of the S-protein and how these structures facilitate analysis of virus function and evolution. We emphasize the differences in reported structures and that analysis of structure-function relationships is sensitive to the structure used. We show that the average residue solvent exposure in nearly complete structures is a good descriptor of open vs closed conformation states. Because of structural heterogeneity of functionally important surface-exposed residues, we recommend using averages of a group of high-quality protein structures rather than a single structure before reaching conclusions on specific structure-function relationships. To illustrate these points, we analyze some significant chemical tendencies of prominent S-protein mutations in the context of the available structures. In the discussion of new variants, we emphasize the selectivity of binding to ACE2 vs prominent antibodies rather than simply the antibody escape or ACE2 affinity separately. We note that larger chemical changes, in particular increased electrostatic charge or side-chain volume of exposed surface residues, are recurring in mutations of concern, plausibly related to adaptation to the negative surface potential of human ACE2. We also find indications that the fixated mutations of the S-protein in the main variants are less destabilizing than would be expected on average, possibly pointing toward a selection pressure on the S-protein. The richness of available structures for all of these situations provides an enormously valuable basis for future research into these structure-function relationships.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vaccines are proving to be highly effective in controlling hospitalisation and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection but the emergence of viral variants with novel antigenic profiles threatens to diminish their efficacy. Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here, we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals, the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351 (South African) variant (6.29-fold reduction) that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2, conferred reductions in titre of 7.77, 11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses, the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69, 4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs, and others, demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly, booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity.',\n",

This risk may be avoided by inclusion of several antigens in vaccines, so that a variant that evades the immune response to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus will be destroyed by the protective immune response against other viral antigens. A simple way for preparing multi-antigenic enveloped-virus vaccines is using the inactivated whole-virus as vaccine. However, immunogenicity of such vaccines may be suboptimal because of poor uptake of the vaccine by antigen-presenting-cells (APC) due to electrostatic repulsion by the negative charges of sialic-acid on both the glycan-shield of the vaccinating virus and on the carbohydrate-chains (glycans) of APC. In addition, glycan-shield can mask many antigenic peptides. These effects of the glycan-shield can be reduced and immunogenicity of the vaccinating virus markedly increased by glycoengineering viral glycans for replacing sialic-acid units on glycans with α-gal epitopes (Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R).

       "  'abstract': 'The appearance of multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants during the COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of grave concern. Some of these variants, such as B.1.617.2, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351, manifest higher infectivity and virulence than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, with potential dramatic effects on the course of the pandemic. So far, analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast, insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the Spike (S) protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Here, we identify 346 unique inserts of different lengths in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing artifacts. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. At least three inserts in the N-terminal domain of the S protein are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies, whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity. Thus, inserts in the S protein can affect its antigenic properties and merit monitoring.',\n",

We applied this technology to study seven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) viral proteins to understand better their effects on autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and cell growth.

       "  'abstract': 'The high transmission and mortality rates associated with SARS-CoV-2 have led to tragic consequences worldwide. Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome since its identification in late 2019 has identified many sequence changes and the emergence of novel strains, each described by co-segregation of a particular set of sequence variations. Variants designated G, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), and delta (B.1.617.2) are important lineages that emerged sequentially and are considered variants of concern. A notable feature of the last four, each of which ultimately evolved from clade G, is the large number (≥ 20) of co-segregating sequence variations associated with them. Several variations are in the spike gene, and some variations are shared among or between strains. Meanwhile, observation of recurrent infections with the same or different SARS-CoV-2 lineages has raised concerns about the duration of the immune responses induced by the initial infection or the vaccine that was administered. While the alpha strain is sensitive to immune responses induced by earlier strains, the beta, gamma, and delta strains can escape antibody neutralization. Apart from random replication errors, intra-host RNA editing, chronic infections, and recombination are processes that may promote the accumulation of sequence changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The known contribution of recombination to coronavirus evolution and recent data pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that recombination may be particularly important. Continued surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is imperative.',\n",

We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1831 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-associated TCRs that have strong evidence of restriction to patients with a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 59.7% (1093/1831) were more abundant among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.01), demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development.

Our experiments reveal that antibodies targeting the S-trimer typically prefer stoichiometries lower than the symmetry-predicted 3:1 binding. We determine that this behavior arises from the interplay of steric clashes and avidity effects that are not reflected in common antibody constructs (i.e., Fabs). Surprisingly, these substoichiometric complexes are fully effective at blocking ACE2 binding despite containing free receptor binding sites.

Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients in this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG). Whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated (e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency) remains a pressing question for this patient population.\\nWe investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until June 2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from May 2020 to August 2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present.\\nFinal containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 single plasma donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations.\\nCP donations presented with high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were not/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 600\\xa0IU/mL. IVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities for SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021 entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 21\\xa0IU/mL in December 2020 to 506\\xa0IU/mL in June 2021 with a maximum of 864\\xa0IU/mL for the most recent lots. Pharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published pharmacokinetic investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16\\xa0IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from May 2021 of 216\\xa0IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64\\xa0IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in June 2021.\\nSARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until Fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products, implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients.\\nPeople with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens such as bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins [Ig]) are prepared from plasma, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells, of healthy donors. This plasma is then split up during pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864\\xa0IU/mL. Considering that the US represents Octapharma’s main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG) neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially reach a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection.',\n",

Development and validation were performed under regulatory guidelines, and the test obtained emergency use authorization (EUA) from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Mount Sinai coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody assay is an orthogonal, quantitative direct ELISA test which detects antibodies reactive to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the spike protein of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The assay is performed on 96-well plates coated with either SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD or spike proteins. The test is divided into two stages, a qualitative screening assay against RBD and a quantitative assay against the full-length spike protein. The test uses pooled high titer serum as a reference standard. Negative pre-COVID-19 and positive post-COVID-19, PCR-confirmed specimens were incorporated in each ELISA test run, and the assays were performed independently at two different locations. The Mount Sinai COVID-19 serology performed with high sensitivity and specificity, 92.5% (95% CI: 0.785-0.980) and 100% (CI: 0.939-1.000) respectively. Between-run precision was assessed with a single run repeated over 22 days; and within-run precision was assessed with 10 replicates per day over 22 days. Both were within reported acceptance criteria (CV ≤ 20%).

       "  'abstract': 'Exploring reliable and highly-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antibody diagnosis by point-of-care (POC) manner, holds great public health significance for extensive COVID-19 screening and controlling. Unfortunately, the currently applied gold based lateral flow immunoassay (GLFIA) may expose both false-negative and false-positive interpretations owing to the sensitivity and specificity limitations, which may cause significant risk and waste of public resources for large population screening. To simultaneously overcome the drawbacks of GLFIA, a novel fluorescent LFIA based on signal amplification and dual-antigen sandwich structure was established with largely improved sensitivity and specificity. The compact three-dimensional incorporation of hydrophobic quantum dots within dendritic affinity templates and multilayer surface derivation guaranteed a high and robust fluorescence of single label, which lowered the false negative rate of GLFIA prominently. A dual-antigen sandwich structure using labeled/immobilized SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain antigen for capturing total human SARS-CoV-2 antibody was developed, instead of general indirect antibody capturing approach, to reduce the false positive rate of GLFIA. Over 300 cases of COVID-19 negative and 97 cases of COVID-19 positive samples, the current assay revealed a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity confirmed by both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), compared with the considerable misinterpretation cases by currently applied GLFIA. The quantitative results verified by receiver operating characteristic curve and other statistical analysis indicated a well-distinguished positive/negative sample groups. The proposed strategy is highly sensitive towards low concentrated SARS-CoV-2 antibody serums and highly specific towards serums from COVID-19 negative persons and patients infected by other viruses.',\n",

First, intranasal and intratracheal challenge of eight pigs did not result in infection, based on clinical signs and PCR on swab and lung tissue samples. Two serum samples returned a low positive result in virus neutralization, in line with findings in other infection experiments in pigs. Next, a retrospective observational study was performed in the Netherlands in the spring of 2020. Serum samples (N =417) obtained at slaughter from 17 farms located in a region with a high human case incidence in the first wave of the pandemic. Samples were tested with protein micro array, plaque reduction neutralization test and receptor-binding-domain ELISA. None of the serum samples was positive in all three assays, although six samples from one farm returned a low positive result in PRNT (titers 40-80). Therefore we conclude that serological evidence for large scale transmission was not observed. Finally, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs on one farm, coinciding with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected animal caretakers, was investigated. Tonsil swabs and paired serum samples were tested. No evidence for infection with SARS-CoV-2 was found. In conclusion, Although in both the experimental and the observational study few samples returned low antibody titer results in PRNT infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not confirmed.

Viruses can hijack the glycosylation machinery of host cells to shield themselves from the host's immune response and attenuate antibody efficiency. However, it remains unclear if targeting glycosylation on viral spike protein can impair infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.\\nWe adopted flow cytometry, ELISA, and BioLayer interferometry approaches to assess binding of glycosylated or deglycosylated spike with ACE2. Viral entry was determined by luciferase, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed a significant relationship between STT3A and COVID-19 severity. NF-κB/STT3A-regulated N-glycosylation was investigated by gene knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter assay. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that couples non-neutralization anti-spike antibody with NGI-1 (4G10-ADC) to specifically target SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.\\nThe receptor binding domain and three distinct SARS-CoV-2 surface N-glycosylation sites among 57,311 spike proteins retrieved from the NCBI-Virus-database are highly evolutionarily conserved (99.67%) and are involved in ACE2 interaction. STT3A is a key glycosyltransferase catalyzing spike glycosylation and is positively correlated with COVID-19 severity. We found that inhibiting STT3A using N-linked glycosylation inhibitor-1 (NGI-1) impaired SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that of its variants [Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351)]. Most importantly, 4G10-ADC enters SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and NGI-1 is subsequently released to deglycosylate spike protein, thereby reinforcing the neutralizing abilities of antibodies, vaccines, or convalescent sera and reducing SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity.\\nOur results indicate that targeting evolutionarily-conserved STT3A-mediated glycosylation via an ADC can exert profound impacts on SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity.

A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate (PGS) was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells. The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice. In particular, RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1 : 1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1 : 42000, in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group. The pVAX-RBD-PGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response. Using ELISpot, it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF-y in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool.

       "  'abstract': 'Host cellular receptors play key roles in the determination of virus tropism and pathogenesis. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 host receptors with the exception of ACE2. Furthermore, ACE2 alone cannot explain the multi-organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting the involvement of other receptor(s). Here, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen 5054 human membrane proteins individually for interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein. Twelve proteins, including ACE2, ASGR1, and KREMEN1, were identified with diverse S-binding affinities and patterns. ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes distinct ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) receptor combinations to enter different cell types, and the expression of ASK together displays a markedly stronger correlation with virus susceptibility than that of any individual receptor at both the cell and tissue levels. The cocktail of ASK-related neutralizing antibodies provides the most substantial blockage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids when compared to individual antibodies. Our study revealed an interacting host receptome of SARS-CoV-2, and identified ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as alternative functional receptors that play essential roles in ACE2-independent virus entry, providing insight into SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis, as well as a community resource and potential therapeutic strategies for further COVID-19 investigations.',\n",

Understanding the evolution of the virus and the impact of genetic variability on host immune evasion and vaccine efficacy is helpful to design novel strategies to minimize the effects of the emerging variants of concern (VOC). Most vaccines under development and/or in current use target the spike protein owning to its unique function of host receptor binding, relatively conserved nature, potent immunogenicity in inducing neutralizing antibodies, and being a good target of T cell responses. However, emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains are exhibiting variability on the spike protein which could affect the efficacy of vaccines and antibody-based therapies in addition to enhancing viral immune evasion mechanisms. Currently, the degree to which mutations on the spike protein affect immunity and vaccination, and the ability of the current vaccines to confer protection against the emerging variants attracts much attention. This review discusses the implications of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations on immune evasion and vaccine-induced immunity and forward directions which could contribute to future studies focusing on designing effective vaccines and/or immunotherapies to consider viral evolution. Combining vaccines derived from different regions of the spike protein that boost both the humoral and cellular wings of adaptive immunity could be the best options to cope with the emerging VOC.',\n",

Immunogenicity studies revealed strong antibody responses in C57BL/6 mice with non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted (7909 CpG) formulations. The non-adjuvanted vaccine induced a balanced Th1/Th2 response and antibodies that recognized both the S1 domain and full S protein from SARS2-CoV-2, whereas the adjuvanted vaccine induced a Th1-biased response. Both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines induced virus neutralizing titers as measured by three different assays.

Our study evaluated the performance characteristics of two high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assays (Abbott Architect and Roche) and The Binding Site (TBS) Anti-Spike IgG/A/M ELISA kit in samples from healthcare workers (HCWs). The 252 samples were collected from multi-site NHS trusts and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Assay performance was evaluated between these three platforms and ROC curves were used to redefine the Abbott threshold. Concordance between Abbott and TBS was 66%. Any discrepant results were analysed using Roche, which showed 100% concordance with TBS. Analysis conducted in HCWs within 58 days post-PCR result demonstrated 100% sensitivity for both Abbott and Roche. Longitudinal analysis for >100 days post-PCR led to sensitivity of 77.2% and 100% for Abbott and Roche, respectively. A redefined Abbott threshold (0.64) increased sensitivity to 90%, producing results comparable to TBS and Roche. The manufacturer's threshold set by Abbott contributes to lower sensitivity and elevated false-negative occurrences. Abbott performance improved upon re-optimisation of the cut-off threshold.

The emergence of these \"variants of concern\" has increased immune escape and has supplanted the ancestral strains. The novel variants harbored by the B.1.617 lineage (kappa and delta) carry mutations within the receptor-binding domain of spike (S) protein (L452R + E484Q and L452R + T478K), the region binding to the host receptor. The double mutations carried by these novel variants are primarily responsible for an upsurge number of COVID-19 cases in India. In this study, we thoroughly investigated the impact of these double mutations on the binding capability to the human host receptor. We performed several structural analyses and found that the studied double mutations increase the binding affinity of the spike protein to the human host receptor (ACE2). Furthermore, our study showed that these double mutants might be a dominant contributor enhancing the receptor-binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently making it more stable. We also investigated the impact of these mutations on the binding affinity of two monoclonal antibodies (Abs) (2-15 and LY-CoV555) and found that the presence of the double mutations also hinders its binding with the studied Abs. The principal component analysis, free energy landscape, intermolecular interaction, and other investigations provided a deeper structural insight to better understand the molecular mechanism responsible for increased viral transmissibility of these variants.',\n",

Compared to other SARS-CoV-2 genes, mutations in the spike protein gene are more rapidly selected and spread within the population, which carries the risk of impairing the efficacy of spike-based vaccines. It is unclear to what extent the loss of neutralizing antibody epitopes can be compensated by cellular immune responses, and whether the use of other SARS-CoV-2 antigens might cause a more diverse immune response and better long-term protection, particularly in light of the continued evolution towards new SARS-CoV-2 variants. To address this question, we explored immunogenicity and protective effects of adenoviral vectors encoding either the full-length spike protein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N), the receptor binding domain (RBD) or a hybrid construct of RBD and the membrane protein (M) in a highly susceptible COVID-19 hamster model. All adenoviral vaccines provided life-saving protection against SARS-CoV-2-infection. The most efficient protection was achieved after exposure to full-length spike. However, the nucleocapsid protein, which triggered a robust T-cell response but did not facilitate the formation of neutralizing antibodies, controlled early virus replication efficiently and prevented severe pneumonia. Although the full-length spike protein is an excellent target for vaccines, it does not appear to be the only option for future vaccine design.',\n",

Here we exploited a naïve human single chain antibody phage display library, to isolate binders against carefully chosen ORF3a recombinant epitopes located towards the extracellular N terminal and cytosolic C terminal domains of the protein using peptide antigens. These binders were subjected to further characterization using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis to assess their binding affinities to the target epitopes. Binding to full-length ORF3a protein was evaluated by western blot and fluorescent microscopy using ORF3a transfected cells and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Co-localization analysis was also performed to evaluate the \"pairing potential\" of the selected binders as possible alternative diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 infections. Both ORF3a N and C termini, epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies were identified in our study. Whilst the linear nature of peptides might not always represent their native conformations in the context of full protein, with carefully designed selection protocols, we have been successful in isolating anti-ORF3a binders capable of recognising regions of the transmembrane protein that are exposed either on the \"inside\" or \"outside\" of the infected cell. Their therapeutic potential will be discussed.',\n",

The major variations among nAbs are based on the genotype responsible for the infection. Patients previously infected with the beta and B.1.160 variants had the lowest nAb titres. We show that this heterogeneity is well explained by spike protein mutants modelling using in silico approaches. The highest titres were observed in individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, even against the delta variant.\\nImmunity acquired naturally after infection is highly dependent on the infecting variant, and, unexpectedly, mRNA-based vaccine efficacy was shown to be often better than natural immunity in eliciting neutralising antibodies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Global efforts are being made to monitor the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, aiming for early identification of genotypes providing increased infectivity or virulence. However, viral lineage-focused tracking might fail in early detection of advantageous mutations emerging independently across phylogenies. Here, the emergence patterns of Spike mutations were investigated in sequences deposited in local and global databases to identify mutational hotspots across phylogenies and we evaluated their impact on SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We found a striking increase in the frequency of recruitment of diverse substitutions at a critical residue (W152), positioned in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Spike protein, observed repeatedly across independent phylogenetic and geographical contexts. These mutations might have an impact on the evasion of neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we found that NTD is a region exhibiting particularly high frequency of mutation recruitments, suggesting an evolutionary path in which the virus maintains optimal efficiency of ACE2 binding combined with the flexibility facilitating the immune escape. We conclude that adaptive mutations, frequently present outside of the receptor-binding domain, can emerge in virtually any SARS-CoV-2 lineage and at any geographical location. Therefore, surveillance should not be restricted to monitoring defined lineages alone.',\n",

Since no specific drugs have been made available yet and there is an imbalance between supply and demand for vaccines, early diagnosis and isolation are essential to control the outbreak. Current nucleic acid testing methods require high sample quality and laboratory conditions, which cannot meet flexible applications. Here, we report a laser-induced graphene field-effect transistor (LIG-FET) for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The FET was manufactured by different reduction degree LIG, with an oyster reef-like porous graphene channel to enrich the binding point between the virus protein and sensing area. After immobilizing specific antibodies in the channel, the FET can detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 15 min at a concentration of 1 pg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 ng/mL in human serum. In addition, the sensor shows great specificity to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our sensors can realize fast production for COVID-19 rapid testing, as each LIG-FET can be fabricated by a laser platform in seconds. It is the first time that LIG has realized a virus sensing FET without any sample pretreatment or labeling, which paves the way for low-cost and rapid detection of COVID-19.',\n",

The level of neutralizing antibodies following the vaccination will evolve with time and vary between individuals. Immunoassays quantifying immunoglobulins against the viral spike (S) protein in serum/plasma have been developed, but the need for venous blood samples could limit the frequency and scale of control in populations. The use of a quantitative dried blood spot (DBS) that can be self-collected would simplify this monitoring. The objective of this study was to determine whether a quantitative DBS device (Capitainer qDBS 10 µL) could be used in combination with an Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay from Roche to follow the development and persistence of anti-S antibodies. This objective was carried out through two clinical studies. The first study investigated 14 volunteers who received two doses of the Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine. The levels of anti-S antibodies and the progression over time post-vaccination were studied for three months. The level of produced antibodies varied between subjects, but a similar trend was observed. The anti-S antibodies were highly stimulated by the second dose (×100) and peaked two weeks later. The antibody levels subsequently decreased and three months later were down to 65%. DBS proved to be sufficiently sensitive for use in evaluating the immune status against SARS-CoV-2 over a prolonged time. The second cohort was composed of 200 random patients from a clinical chemistry department in Stockholm. In this cohort, we had no information on previous COVID-19 infections or vaccination. Nevertheless, 87% of the subjects had anti-S immunoglobulins over 0.8 U/mL, and the bias between plasma and DBS proved to be variable, as was also seen in the first vaccination study.',\n",

The cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV (2002) was also assessed. We used infectious and inactivated SARS-CoV-2/human/RUS/Nsk-FRCFTM-1/2020 strain, inactivated SARS-CoV strain (strain Frankfurt 1, 2002), recombinant proteins, and blood sera of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The blood sera from patients were analyzed by the Virus Neutralization test, Immunoblotting, and ELISA. The median values and mean ± SD of titers of specific and cross-reactive antibodies in blood sera tested in ELISA were mainly distributed in the following descending order: N > trimer S > RBD. ELISA and immunoblotting revealed a high cross-activity of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-CoV antigen (2002), mainly with the N protein. The presence of antibodies specific to RBD corresponds with the data on the neutralizing activity of blood sera. According to the neutralization test in a number of cases, higher levels of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood serum taken from patients several days before their death than in convalescents with a ranging disease severity. This high level of neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood sera of patients who subsequently died in hospital from COVID-19 requires a thorough study of the role of humoral immunity as well as comorbidity and other factors affecting the humoral response in this disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since 2020, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been constantly mutating, producing most of the notable missense mutations in the context of \"variants of concern\", probably in response to the vaccine-driven alteration of immune profiles of the human population. The Delta variant, in particular, has become the most prevalent variant of the epidemic, and it is spreading in countries with the highest vaccination rates, causing the world to face the risk of a new wave of the contagion. Understanding the physical mechanism responsible for the mutation-induced changes in the RBD\\'s binding affinity, its transmissibility, and its capacity to escape vaccine-induced immunity is the \"urgent challenge\" in the development of preventive measures, vaccines, and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, entropy-enthalpy compensation and the Gibbs free energy change were used to analyze the impact of the RBD mutations on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants with the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and existing antibodies. Through the analysis, we found that the existing mutations have already covered almost all possible detrimental mutations that could result in an increase of transmissibility, and that a possible mutation in amino-acid position 498 of the RBD can potentially enhance its binding affinity. A new calculation method for the binding energies of protein-protein complexes is proposed based on the entropy-enthalpy compensation rule. All known structures of RBD-antibody complexes and the RBD-ACE2 complex comply with the entropy-enthalpy compensation rule in providing the driving force behind the spontaneous protein-protein docking. The variant-induced risk of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people is attributed to the L452R mutation\\'s reduction of the binding affinity of many antibodies. Mutations reversing the hydrophobic or hydrophilic performance of residues in the spike RBD potentially cause breakthrough infections of coronaviruses due to the changes in geometric complementarity in the entropy-enthalpy compensations between antibodies and the virus at the binding sites.',\n",

The profiling results show that, although all recipients exhibit expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses, CP units contain more functional antibodies than recipient plasma. Meanwhile, CP functional profiles influence the evolution of recipient humoral immunity in conjuncture with the recipient's pre-existing SARS-CoV2-specific antibody titers: CP-derived SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific antibody functions are associated with muted humoral immune evolution in patients with high titer anti-spike IgG.

       "  'abstract': 'Considering the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments. At present, neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule drugs such as remdesivir, the most promising compound to treat this infection, have attracted considerable attention. However, some potential problems need to be concerned including viral resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization caused by selective pressure from a single antibody treatment, the unexpected antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, and the toxic effect of small-molecule drugs.\\nHere, we constructed a type of programmed nanovesicle (NV) derived from bispecific CAR-T cells that express two single-chain fragment variables (scFv), named CR3022 and B38, to target SARS-CoV-2. Nanovesicles that express both CR3022 and B38 (CR3022/B38 NVs) have a stronger ability to neutralize Spike-pseudovirus infectivity than nanovesicles that express either CR3022 or B38 alone. Notably, the co-expression of CR3022 and B38, which target different epitopes of spike protein, could reduce the incidence of viral resistance. Moreover, the lack of Fc fragments on the surface of CR3022/B38 NVs could prevent ADE effects. Furthermore, the specific binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the drug loading capacity of CR3022/B38 NVs can facilitate targeted delivery of remdesiver to 293\\xa0T cells overexpressing spike protein. These results suggest that CR3022/B38 NVs have the potential ability to target antiviral drugs to the main site of viral infection, thereby enhancing the antiviral ability by inhibiting intracellular viral replication and reducing adverse drug reactions.\\nIn summary, we demonstrate that nanovesicles derived from CAR-T cells targeting the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 have the ability to neutralize Spike-pseudotyped virus and target antiviral drugs. This novel therapeutic approach may help to solve the dilemma faced by neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.',\n",

For all analyzed sera a reduction in binding and neutralizing antibodies was found for the lineage B.1.351 variant of concern. SPR analyses revealed that the CVnCoV-elicited sera have a lower fraction of slow-dissociating antibodies. Accordingly, the CVnCoV sera almost fail to compete with the spike-ACE2 interaction. The significance of common VOC mutations K417N, E484K, or N501Y focused on linear epitopes was analyzed using a peptide array approach. The peptide arrays showed a strong difference between convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. Specifically, the linear epitope at position N501 was affected by the mutation and elucidates the escape of viral variants to antibodies against this linear epitope.\\nThese data reveal differences in titer, neutralizing capacity, and affinity of the antibodies between BNT162b2- and CVnCoV-elicited sera, which could contribute to the apparent differences in vaccine efficacy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants have continued to emerge in diverse geographic locations with a temporal distribution. The Lambda variant containing multiple mutations in the spike protein, has thus far appeared mainly in South America. The variant harbours two mutations in the receptor binding domain, L452Q and F490S, which may change its infectivity and antigenicity to neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we constructed 10 pseudoviruses to study the Lambda variant and each individual amino acid mutation's effect on viral function, and used eight cell lines to study variant infectivity. In total, 12 monoclonal antibodies, 14 convalescent sera, and 23 immunized sera induced by mRNA vaccines, inactivated vaccine, and adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine were used to study the antigenicity of the Lambda variant. We found that compared with the D614G reference strain, Lambda demonstrated enhanced infectivity of Calu-3 and LLC-MK2 cells by 3.3-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of the Lambda variant to 5 of 12 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, 9G11, AM180, R126, X593, and AbG3, was substantially diminished. Furthermore, convalescent- and vaccine-immunized sera showed on average 1.3-2.5-fold lower neutralizing titres against the Lambda variant. Single mutation analysis revealed that this reduction in neutralization was caused by L452Q and F490S mutations. Collectively, the reduced neutralization ability of the Lambda variant suggests that the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines may be compromised during the current pandemic.\",\n",

In both vaccines, sCOVG, CoV-2 IgG II, and cPASS showed a high seropositive rate (>95.7%) except for cPASS after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (68.8%). Using sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II, the ratios of antibody value (second/first) increased 10.6- and 11.4-fold in BNT162b2 (first 14.1, second 134.8 U/ml; first 1,416.2, second 14,326.4\\u2009AU/ml) and 2.3- and 2.0-fold in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (first 4.0, second 9.1 U/ml; first 431.0, second 9,744.0\\u2009AU/ml). cPASS-positive results indicated a very high concordance rate with sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II (>98%), whereas cPASS-negative results showed a relatively low concordance rate (range of 22.2% to 66.7%). To predict cPASS positivity, we suggested additional cutoffs for sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II at 2.42 U/ml and 284\\u2009AU/ml, respectively. In conclusion, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 evoked robust humoral responses. sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II showed a very strong correlation with cPASS. sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II may predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

       "  'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, uses its spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral membrane to enter host cells. The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by co-expression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to purify the Golgi-modified fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on other characterized S trimer preparations, is predominantly modified in the Golgi compartment by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions. ',\n",

The disease has caused more than 5.1 million deaths worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are frequently the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood.\\nIn this study, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes. We studied uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as pseudotyped viral particles by human iPS cell derived podocytes using qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes (including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33) associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing.\\nInfection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes.\\nThese results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes \\nMany patients with COVID19 disease exhibit multiorgan complications, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can extend beyond the respiratory system. Acute kidney injury is a common COVID-19 complication contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Still, SARS-Cov-2 affinity for specialized kidney cells remain less clear. By leveraging our protocol for stem cell differentiation, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney glomerular podocytes by using multiple Spike-binding proteins including ACE2 and BSG/CD147. Our results also indicate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause podocyte cell death and foot process effacement, a hallmark of podocytopathies including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.',\n",

We aimed to clarify whether SIgA in saliva cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit in individuals who have not been infected with this virus. The study involved 137 (men, n = 101; women, n = 36; mean age, 38.7; age range, 24-65 years) dentists and doctors from Kanagawa Dental University Hospital. Saliva and blood samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunochromatography for IgG and IgM, respectively. We then identified patients with saliva samples that were confirmed to be PCR-negative and IgM-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The cross-reactivity of IgA-positive saliva samples with SARS-CoV-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotin-labeled spike recombinant protein (S1-mFc) covering the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals was 46.7%, which correlated negatively with age (r = -0.218, p = 0.01). The proportion of IgA-positive individuals aged ≥50 years was significantly lower than that of patients aged ≤49 years (p = 0.008). SIgA was purified from the saliva of patients, which could partially suppress the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor. This study demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive SIgA in the saliva of individuals who had never been infected with the virus, suggesting that SIgA may help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

We found an 11- to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2- to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in macaques and humans, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

       "  'abstract': 'Young age, female sex, absence of comorbidities, and prior infection or vaccination are known epidemiological barriers for contracting the new infection and/or increased disease severity. Demographic trends from the recent coronavirus disease 2019 waves, which are believed to be driven by newer severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, indicate that the aforementioned epidemiological barriers are being breached and a larger number of younger and healthy individuals are developing severe disease. The new SARS-CoV-2 variants have key mutations that can induce significant changes in the virus-host interactions. Recent studies report that, some of these mutations, singly or in a group, enhance key mechanisms, such as binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the host-cells, increase the glycosylation of spike protein at the antigenic sites, and enhance the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein, thus leading to improved host-cell entry and the replication of the virus. The putative changes in the virus-host interactions imparted by the mutations in the RBD sequence can potentially be the reason behind the breach of the observed epidemiological barriers. Susceptibility for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease outcomes are known to be influenced by host-cell expressions of ACE2 and other proteases. The new variants can act more efficiently, and even with the lesser availability of the viral entry-receptor and the associated proteases, can have more efficient host-cell entry and greater replication resulting in high viral loads and prolonged viral shedding, widespread tissue-injury, and severe inflammation leading to increased transmissibility and lethality. Furthermore, the accumulating evidence shows that multiple new variants have reduced neutralization by both, natural and vaccine-acquired antibodies, indicating that repeated and vaccine breakthrough infections may arise as serious health concerns in the ongoing pandemic.',\n",

In addition, for antibodies that target the spike protein (SP), it's unclear if these reduce SARS-CoV-2/SP multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled SP-NIRF to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system and ex in vivo tissue analysis, in young mice. We found a SP body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. SP uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or CSF. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of SP into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-ACE2 and anti-SP antibodies suppressed SP biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-SP antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 multiorgan tropism, which could determine COVID-19 organ-specific outcomes.\",\n",

Serological response was evaluated by quantifying the Region-Binding-Domain (RBD) and neutralizing-antibodies. Cell-mediated response was analyzed by a whole-blood test quantifying interferon (IFN)-γ response to spike peptides. Cells responding to spike stimulation were identified by FACS analysis.\\nWe prospectively enrolled 186 vaccinated individuals: 78 HCWs and 108 MS patients. Twenty-eight MS patients were treated with IFN-β, 35 with fingolimod, 20 with cladribine, and 25 with ocrelizumab. A lower anti-RBD-antibody response rate was found in patients treated with ocrelizumab (40%, p<0.0001) and fingolimod (85.7%, p=0.0023) compared to HCWs and patients treated with cladribine or IFN-β. Anti-RBD-antibody median titer was lower in patients treated with ocrelizumab (p<0.0001), fingolimod (p<0.0001) and cladribine (p=0.010) compared to HCWs and IFN-β-treated patients. Importantly, serum neutralizing activity was present in all the HCWs tested and only in a minority of the fingolimod-treated patients (16.6%). T-cell-specific response was detected in the majority of MS patients (62%), albeit with significantly lower IFN-γ levels compared to HCWs. The lowest frequency of T-cell response was found in fingolimod-treated patients (14.3%). T-cell-specific response correlated with lymphocyte count and anti-RBD antibody titer (rho=0.554, p<0.0001 and rho=0.255, p=0.0078 respectively). Finally, IFN-γ T-cell response was mediated by both CD4\\nmRNA vaccines induce both humoral and cell-mediated specific immune responses against spike peptides in all HCWs and in the majority of MS patients.

In this study, we present free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, performed at the end of December 2020, for the interactions of the spike S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody derived from COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interactions were significantly increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody dramatically decreased. The K417N mutation in a combination with N501Y fully abolished the antibody effect. However, Lys417Asn seems to have a compensatory mechanism of action increasing the S1 RBD-ACE2 free energy of binding. This may explain the increased spread of the virus observed in the U.K. and South Africa and also gives rise to an important question regarding the possible human immune response and the success of the already available vaccines. Notably, when the experimental data became available confirming our calculations, it was demonstrated that protein-protein FEP can be a useful tool for providing urgent data to the scientific community.',\n",

The magnitude and the neutralizing properties of the response were heterogeneous regardless of the severity of the disease. Antibody levels dropped over time, even though spike reactive IgG and IgA were still detectable up to 9 months. Early baseline antibody levels were key drivers of the subsequent antibody production and the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Protective antibody-mediated viral neutralization in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been firmly characterized. Where the effects of the antibody response are generally considered to be beneficial, an important biological question regarding potential negative outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody response has yet to be answered. We determined the distribution of IgG subclasses and complement activation levels in plasma from convalescent individuals using in-house developed ELISAs. The IgG response towards SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) after natural infection appeared to be mainly driven by IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, which are the main ligands for C1q mediated classical complement pathway activation. The deposition of the complement components C4b, C3bc, and TCC as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were depending primarily on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and significantly correlated with both IgG levels and disease severity, indicating that individuals with high levels of IgG and/or severe disease, might have a more prominent complement activation during viral infection. Finally, freshly isolated monocytes and a monocyte cell line (THP-1) were used to address the cellular mediated inflammatory response as a consequence of Fc-gamma receptor engagement by SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Monocytic Fc gamma receptor charging resulted in a significant rise in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might drive significant inflammatory responses through the classical complement pathway and ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In less than two years since SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has accumulated a great number of mutations. Many of these mutations are located in the Spike protein and some of them confer to the virus higher transmissibility or partial resistance to antibody mediated neutralization. Viral variants with such confirmed abilities are designated by WHO as Variants of Concern (VOCs). The aim of this study was to monitor the introduction of variants and VOCs in Venezuela. A small fragment of the viral genome was sequenced for the detection of the most relevant mutations found in VOCs. This approach allowed the detection of Gamma VOC. Its presence was confirmed by complete genome sequencing. The Gamma VOC was detected in Venezuela since January 2021, and in March 2021 was predominant in the East and Central side of the country, representing more than 95% of cases sequenced in all the country in April-May 2021. In addition to the Gamma VOC, other isolates carrying the mutation E484K were also detected. The frequency of this mutation has been increasing worldwide, as shown in a survey of sequences carrying E484K mutation in GISAID, and was detected in Venezuela in many probable cases of reinfection. Complete genome sequencing of these cases allowed us to identify E484K mutation in association with Gamma VOC and other lineages. In conclusion, the strategy adopted in this study is suitable for genomic surveillance of variants for countries lacking robust genome sequencing capacities. In the period studied, Gamma VOC seems to have rapidly become the dominant variant throughout the country.',\n",

Here, we show that the stalk length is critical for the folding and stability of antibodies with an ultra-long CDR and that the disulfide bonds in the knob do not contribute to stability; they are important for organizing the antigen-binding knob structure. The bovine ultra-long CDR can be integrated into human antibody scaffolds.

ABCORA seroprofiling, when combined with computational modeling, enables accurate definition of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and prediction of neutralization activity, and reveals intriguing interrelations with HCoV immunity. Specifically, higher HCoV antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-negative donors suggest that pre-existing HCoV immunity may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In those infected, higher HCoV activity is associated with elevated SARS-CoV-2 responses, indicating cross-stimulation. Most importantly, HCoV immunity may impact disease severity, as patients with high HCoV reactivity are less likely to require hospitalization. Collectively, our results suggest that HCoV immunity may promote rapid development of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity, thereby underscoring the importance of exploring cross-protective responses for comprehensive coronavirus prevention.',\n",

The receptor binding motif (RBM), located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, incorporates the majority of known ACE2 contact residues responsible for high affinity binding and associated virulence. Observation of existing crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (SRBD)-ACE2 interface, combined with peptide array screening, allowed us to define a series of linear native RBM-derived peptides that were selected as potential antiviral decoy sequences with the aim of directly binding ACE2 and attenuating viral cell entry. RBM1 (16mer): S443KVGGNYNYLYRLFRK458, RBM2A (25mer): E484GFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQPY508, RBM2B (20mer): F456NCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGY505 and RBM2A-Sc (25mer): NYGLQGSPFGYQETPYPFCNFVQYG. Data from fluorescence polarisation experiments suggested direct binding between RBM peptides and ACE2, with binding affinities ranging from the high nM to low μM range (Kd = 0.207-1.206 μM). However, the RBM peptides demonstrated only modest effects in preventing SRBD internalisation and showed no antiviral activity in a spike protein trimer neutralisation assay. The RBM peptides also failed to suppress S1-protein mediated inflammation in an endogenously expressing ACE2 human cell line. We conclude that linear native RBM-derived peptides are unable to outcompete viral spike protein for binding to ACE2 and therefore represent a suboptimal approach to inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry. These findings reinforce the notion that larger biologics (such as soluble ACE2, 'miniproteins', nanobodies and antibodies) are likely better suited as SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry inhibitors than short-sequence linear peptides.\",\n",

Among 173 outpatients who had virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated serum antibody concentrations, microneutralization activity, and enumerated SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells in convalescent blood specimens. Serum antibody concentrations were variable, allowing for stratification of the cohort into high and low responders. Serum antibody concentration was positively associated with microneutralization activity and participant age, with participants under the age of 30 showing the lowest antibody level. Neither participant sex, the timing of blood sampling following the onset of illness, nor the number of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific B cells correlated with serum antibody concentration. These data suggest that young adult outpatients did not generate as robust antibody memory, compared with older adults. Further, serum antibody concentration or neutralizing activity trended but did not significantly correlate with the number of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells. These findings have direct implications for public health policy and current vaccine efforts.

The spike proteins of B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 variants have several substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD), including L452R+E484Q, L452R+T478K, and K417N+L452R+T478K, respectively, that could potentially reduce effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and current vaccines. Here we compared B.1.617 variants, and their single and double RBD substitutions for resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Pseudoviruses with the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 spike showed a modest 1.5 to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for pseudoviruses with C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 spikes, but seven- and sixteen-fold reduction for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, was seen for pseudoviruses with the B.1.351 spike. Four of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses due to the L452R substitution, whereas six of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 pseudoviruses due to either the E484Q or L452R substitution. Against AY.1 pseudoviruses, the L452R and K417N substitutions accounted for the loss of neutralization by four antibodies and one antibody, respectively, whereas one antibody lost potency that could not be fully accounted for by a single RBD substitution. The modest resistance of B.1.617 variants to vaccine-elicited sera suggest that current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants, but the therapeutic antibodies need to be carefully selected based on their resistance profiles. Finally, the spike proteins of B.1.617 variants are more efficiently cleaved due to the P681R substitution, and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein. Structural and dynamic data have shown that S can adopt multiple conformations, which controls the exposure of the ACE2-binding site in the RBD. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging we report the effects of ACE2 and antibody binding on the conformational dynamics of S from the Wuhan-1 strain and the B.1 variant (D614G). We find that D614G modulates the energetics of the RBD position in a manner similar to ACE2 binding. We also find that antibodies that target diverse epitopes, including those distal to the RBD, stabilize the RBD in a position competent for ACE2 binding. Parallel solution-based binding experiments using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) indicate antibody-mediated enhancement of ACE2 binding. These findings inform on novel strategies for therapeutic antibody cocktails.',\n",

Second-generation vaccines will need to elicit neutralizing antibodies against sites that are evolutionarily conserved across the sarbecovirus subgenus. Here, we immunized mice containing a human antibody repertoire with diverse sarbecovirus receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to identify antibodies targeting conserved sites of vulnerability. Antibodies with broad reactivity against diverse clade B RBDs targeting the conserved class 4 epitope, with recurring IGHV/IGKV pairs, were readily elicited but were non-neutralizing. However, rare class 4 antibodies binding this conserved RBD supersite showed potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and all variants of concern. Structural analysis revealed that the neutralizing ability of cross-reactive antibodies was reserved only for those with an elongated CDRH3 that extends the antiparallel beta-sheet RBD core and orients the antibody light chain to obstruct ACE2-RBD interactions. These results identify a structurally defined pathway for vaccine strategies eliciting escape-resistant SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Effective vaccines are essential for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CoronaVac, which is an inactivated virus vaccine, was the first imported COVID-19 vaccine in Thailand. To investigate the safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac within the Thai population, we conducted a prospective cohort study among health care workers aged 18-59 years, who received a 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac 21 days apart between March and April 2021 at the hospital in Samut Sakhon, Thailand. We recruited 185 participants with a mean age of 32 years. Total antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 were tested. Total antibodies against RBD were negative before immunization. One volunteer was positive for N, although negative for the RBD antibodies. The seroconversion rate of total antibodies against RBD after the first CoronaVac dose was 67% with a Geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 1.98 U/ml. Following CoronaVac dose 2, the seroconversion rate increased to 100% with a GMC of 92.9 U/ml. The seroconversion rates of IgG against N protein were 1% after dose 1 and 62.8% after dose 2. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 59.5%. Injection-site pain was the most common local adverse event (52.4%), while myalgia was the most common systemic adverse event (31.9%). No serious adverse events were observed. A 0-21 days, 2-dose CoronaVac regimen appears safe, inducing a satisfactory response compared with convalescent serum obtained 4-6 weeks postnatural infection. Antibody responses after 2-dose CoronaVac were comparable to the convalescent plasma but waned rapidly after 3 months. Therefore, we recommend 2-dose CoronaVac administration with possible booster doses.',\n",

To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants, we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417, E484, and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD).

Notably, antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants, suggesting that different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern.

In this study, we described the production of insect-cell expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain constructs and examined their immunogenicity in mice. We demonstrated that, when formulated with CoVaccine HT',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding immune responses toward viral infection will be useful for potential therapeutic intervention and offer insights into the design of prophylactic vaccines. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the complex immune responses toward SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we developed a method to express and purify the recombinant and engineered viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) to more than 95% purity. We could encapsulate RNA molecules into the interior of a virion-sized liposome. We conjugated the purified RBD proteins onto the surface of the liposome in an orientation-specific manner with defined spatial densities. Both the encapsulation of RNAs and the chemical conjugation of the RBD protein on liposome surfaces were stable under physiologically relevant conditions. In contrast to soluble RBD proteins, a single injection of RBD-conjugated liposomes alone, in the absence of any other adjuvants, elicited RBD-specific B cell responses in BALB/c mice, and the resulting animal sera could potently neutralize HIV-1 pseudovirions that displayed the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. These results validate these supramolecular structures as a novel and effective tool to mimic the structure of enveloped viruses, the use of which will allow systematic dissection of the complex B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

Soluble ACE2 ectodomains bind and neutralize the virus, yet their short in vivo half-live limits their therapeutic use. This limitation can be overcome by fusing the fragment crystallizable (Fc) part of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the ACE2 ectodomain, but this bears the risk of Fc-receptor activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Here, we describe optimized ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion constructs that avoid Fc-receptor activation, preserve the desired ACE2 enzymatic activity and show promising pharmaceutical properties. The engineered ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins neutralize the original SARS-CoV, pandemic SARS-CoV-2 as well as the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 alpha, beta and delta variants of concern. Importantly, these variants of concern are inhibited at picomolar concentrations proving that ACE2-IgG4 maintains - in contrast to therapeutic antibodies - its full antiviral potential. Thus, ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins are promising candidate anti-antivirals to combat the current and future pandemics.',\n",

It initiates entry into human cells by binding to the\\xa0peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\\xa0receptor via its receptor binding domain of S1 subunit of spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-RBD). Employing neutralizing antibodies to prevent binding between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 is an effective COVID-19 therapeutic solution. Previous studies found that CC12.3 is a highly potent neutralizing antibody that was isolated from a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient, and its Fab fragment (Fab CC12.3) bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable binding affinity to ACE2. To enhance its binding affinity, we employed computational protein design to redesign all CDRs of Fab CC12.3 and molecular dynamics (MD) to validate their predicted binding affinities by the MM-GBSA method. MD results show that the predicted binding affinities of the three best designed Fabs CC12.3 (CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08) are better than those of Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. Additionally, our results suggest that enhanced binding affinities of CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08 are caused by increased SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding interactions of CDRs L1 and L3.

The newly emerged coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the primary reason for the COVID-19 global pandemic. According to recent global figures, COVID-19 has caused approximately 243.3 million illnesses and 4.9 million deaths. Several human cell receptors are involved in the virus identification of the host cells and entering them. Hence, understanding how the virus binds to host-cell receptors is crucial for developing antiviral treatments and vaccines. The current work aimed to determine the multiple host-cell receptors that bind with SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses for the purpose of cell entry. Extensive research is needed using neutralizing antibodies, natural chemicals, and therapeutic peptides to target those host-cell receptors in extremely susceptible individuals.

       "  'abstract': 'The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency requiring urgent development of efficacious vaccines. While concentrated research efforts have focused primarily on antibody-based vaccines that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccines have either been approved or received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring updated second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e., neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor-binding domain. Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2\\xa0S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2\\xa0S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins and present a new, to our knowledge, approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses.',\n",

Participants received two mRNA-1273 vaccinations of 100 μg in 0·5 mL intramuscularly, 28 days apart. The primary endpoint, analysed per protocol (excluding patients with a positive baseline sample [>10 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL], indicating previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), was defined as the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG serum antibody response (ie, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody concentration of >10 BAU/mL) 28 days after the second vaccination. For the primary endpoint analysis, a non-inferiority design with a margin of 10% was used. We also assessed adverse events in all patients who received at least one vaccination, and recorded solicited adverse events in participants who received at least one vaccination but excluding those who already had seroconversion (>10 BAU/mL) at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04715438.\\nBetween Feb 17 and March 12, 2021, 791 participants were enrolled and followed up for a median of 122 days (IQR 118 to 128).

       "  'abstract': 'In the last 25\\xa0years, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has had a major impact in the successful treatment of previously untreatable or poorly controlled autoimmune neurological disorders. Derived from thousands of healthy donors, IVIg contains IgG1 isotypes of idiotypic antibodies that have the potential to bind pathogenic autoantibodies or cross-react with various antigenic peptides, including proteins conserved among the \"common cold\"-pre-pandemic coronaviruses; as a result, after IVIg infusions, some of the patients\\' sera may transiently become positive for various neuronal antibodies, even for anti-SARS-CoV-2, necessitating caution in separating antibodies derived from the infused IVIg or acquired humoral immunity. IVIg exerts multiple effects on the immunoregulatory network by variably affecting autoantibodies, complement activation, FcRn saturation, FcγRIIb receptors, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators. Based on randomized controlled trials, IVIg is approved for the treatment of GBS, CIDP, MMN and dermatomyositis; has been effective in, myasthenia gravis exacerbations, and stiff-person syndrome; and exhibits convincing efficacy in autoimmune epilepsy, neuromyelitis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Recent evidence suggests that polymorphisms in the genes encoding FcRn and FcγRIIB may influence the catabolism of infused IgG or its anti-inflammatory effects, impacting on individualized dosing or efficacy. For chronic maintenance therapy, IVIg and subcutaneous IgG are effective in controlled studies only in CIDP and MMN preventing relapses and axonal loss up to 48\\xa0weeks; in practice, however, IVIg is continuously used for years in all the aforementioned neurological conditions, like is a \"forever necessary therapy\" for maintaining stability, generating challenges on when and how to stop it. Because about 35-40% of patients on chronic therapy do not exhibit objective neurological signs of worsening after stopping IVIg but express subjective symptoms of fatigue, pains, spasms, or a feeling of generalized weakness, a conditioning effect combined with fear that discontinuing chronic therapy may destabilize a multi-year stability status is likely. The dilemmas of continuing chronic therapy, the importance of adjusting dosing and scheduling or periodically stopping IVIg to objectively assess necessity, and concerns in accurately interpreting IVIg-dependency are discussed. Finally, the merit of subcutaneous IgG, the ineffectiveness of IVIg in IgG4-neurological autoimmunities, and genetic factors affecting IVIg dosing and efficacy are addressed.',\n",

We performed semi-structured pharmacovigilance interviews and monitored donor-specific antibodies and kidney function. We compared levels of anti-spike IgG, pseudo-neutralization activity against vaccine homologous and heterologous variants, frequency of spike-specific interferon (IFN)-γ-secreting cells, and antigen-induced cytokine production 28 days after the second and third doses.\\nReactions to vaccine were mild. One patient developed donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies after the second dose which could be explained by non-adherence to immunosuppressive therapy. Spike-specific IgG seroconversion raised from 44·3% (n=27) after the second dose to 62·3% (n=38) after the third dose (p<0·05). The mean level of spike-specific IgG increased from 1620 (SD, 3460) to 8772 (SD, 16733) AU/ml (p<0·0001). Serum neutralizing activity increased after the third dose for all variants of concern tested including the Delta variant (p<0·0001).

In an effort to develop therapeutic interventions and control the pandemic, scientists have isolated several neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from the vaccinated and convalescent individuals. These antibodies can be explored further to understand SARS-CoV-2 specific antigen-antibody interactions and biophysical parameters related to binding affinity, which can be utilized to engineer more potent antibodies for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the present study, we have analyzed the interface between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibodies in terms of amino acid residue propensity, pair preference, and atomic interaction energy. We observed that Tyr residues containing contacts are highly preferred and energetically favorable at the interface of spike protein-antibody complexes. We have also developed a regression model to relate the experimental binding affinity for antibodies using structural features, which showed a correlation of 0.93. Moreover, several mutations at the spike protein-antibody interface were identified, which may lead to immune escape (epitope residues) and improved affinity (paratope residues) in current/emerging variants. Overall, the work provides insights into spike protein-antibody interactions, structural parameters related to binding affinity and mutational effects on binding affinity change, which can be helpful to develop better therapeutics against COVID-19.',\n",

The database includes simulations produced by leading groups using molecular dynamics (MD) methods to investigate the structure-dynamics-function relationships of viral proteins. SCoV2-MD cross-references the molecular data with the pandemic evolution by tracking all available variants sequenced during the pandemic and deposited in the GISAID resource. SCoV2-MD enables the interactive analysis of the deposited trajectories through a web interface, which enables users to search by viral protein, isolate, phylogenetic attributes, or specific point mutation. Each mutation can then be analyzed interactively combining static (e.g. a variety of amino acid substitution penalties) and dynamic (time-dependent data derived from the dynamics of the local geometry) scores. Dynamic scores can be computed on the basis of nine non-covalent interaction types, including steric properties, solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding, and other types of chemical interactions. Where available, experimental data such as antibody escape and change in binding affinities from deep mutational scanning experiments are also made available. All metrics can be combined to build predefined or custom scores to interrogate the impact of evolving variants on protein structure and function.',\n",

By replacing the VSV glycoprotein with the spikes (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we generated two replication-competent recombinant viruses, rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 and rVSV-SARS-CoV. Using wild-type and human ACE2 (hACE2) knock-in mouse models, we found a single dose of rVSV-SARS-CoV could elicit strong humoral immune response via both intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) routes. Despite the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, no obvious cross-neutralizing activity was observed in the immunized mice sera. In macaques, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers induced by one i.n. dose of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 were eight-fold higher than those by a single i.m. dose. Thus, our data indicates that rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 might be suitable for i.n. administration instead of the traditional i.m. immunization in human. Because rVSV-SARS-CoV elicited significantly stronger NAb responses than rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 in a route-independent manner, we generated a chimeric antigen by replacing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S with that from the SARS-CoV-2. rVSV expressing the chimera (rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD) induced significantly increased NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and macaques than rVSV-SARS-CoV-2, with a safe Th1-biased response. Serum immunized with rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD showed no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV. hACE2 mice receiving a single i.m. dose of either rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 or rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD were fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge without obvious lesions in the lungs. Our results suggest that transplantation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD into the S protein of SARS-CoV might be a promising antigen design for COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were responders cocultured with hUCMSCs or exogenous IL-6. A PBMC suppression assay was used to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects via MTT assay. The IL-6 concentration in the supernatant was measured using ELISA. The correlation between the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCMSCs and IL-6 levels and the relevant roles of IL-6 and IL-6 mRNA expression was analyzed using the MetaCore functional network constructed from gene microarray data. The location of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression was further evaluated. We reported that hUCMSCs did not initially exert any inhibitory effect on PHA-stimulated proliferation; however, a potent inhibitory effect on PHA-stimulated proliferation was observed, and the IL-6 concentration reached approximately 1000 ng/mL after 72 hours. Exogenous 1000 ng/mL IL-6 inhibited PHA-stimulated inflammation but less so than hUCMSCs. The inhibitory effects of hUCMSCs on PHA-stimulated PBMCs disappeared after adding an IL-6 neutralizing antibody or pretreatment with tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6R antagonist. hUCMSCs exert excellent anti-inflammatory effects by inducing higher IL-6 levels, which is different from TCZ. High concentration of IL-6 cytokine secretion plays an important role in the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCMSC therapy. Initial hUCMSC therapy, followed by TCZ, seems to optimize the therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).',\n",

Retaining the infectivity of the rVSV-S during the downstream process was challenged by the shear sensitivity of the enveloped rVSV-S and its membrane protruding spike protein. Through a series of screening experiments, we evaluated and established the required endonuclease treatment conditions, filter train composition, and hollow fiber-tangential flow filtration parameters to remove large particles, reduce the load of impurities, and concentrate and exchange the buffer while retaining rVSV-S infectivity. The combined effect of the first unit operations on viral recovery and the removal of critical impurities was examined during scale-up experiments. Overall, approximately 40% of viral recovery was obtained and the regulatory requirements of less than 10\\xa0ng host cell DNA per dose were met. However, while 86-97% of the host cell proteins were removed, the regulatory acceptable HCP levels were not achieved, requiring subsequent purification and polishing steps. The results we obtained during the scale-up experiments were similar to those obtained during the screening experiments, indicating the scalability of the process. The findings of this study set the foundation for the development of a complete downstream manufacturing process, requiring subsequent purification and polishing unit operations for clinical preparations of rVSV-S.',\n",

We could analyze mutation dynamics across the genome from countries such as the USA, Italy, the UK, France, Brazil, and India considering the rapid mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The analysis would help us to understand the genome diversity, the implications of the mutations in protein stability, and viral transmission. Among the 11 genes, surface glycoprotein (S) was singled out because of its crucial function associated with the entry of virion into the human cell upon binding with the hACE2 receptor. 749 S protein sequences from India were retrieved from the NCBI database for our study. The S protein is an important antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses, neutralizing antibodies, and\\xa0providing protective immunity against viral infection. During an epitope prediction from a mutation-prone S-protein region, it is necessary to ascertain how new mutations significantly change the S protein, such that our vaccine is effective against all the mutated strains as well. The S1 region of the S protein had been our prime focus for identifying immune epitopes against SARS-COV-2. Antigenic B- cell epitopes were YYPDKVF from NTD and LFRKSNLKP from RBD. Cytotoxic T-cell epitopes WTAGAAAYY (within NTD) and CVADYSVLY (within RBD) exhibited binding with a maximum number of MHC I alleles. The T-cell epitopes which showed a maximum affinity for MHC II alleles were FLPFFSNVT within NTD and YFPLQSYGF within RBD.

This is thought to be associated with an impaired activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and which also tightly regulates blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) to a vasopressor peptide. Here, we show that a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies against AngII, whose presence correlates with lower blood oxygenation, blood pressure dysregulation, and overall higher disease severity. Anti-AngII antibodies can develop upon specific immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike or RBD, to which they can cross-bind, suggesting some epitope mimicry between AngII and Spike/RBD.

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 continues with new challenges arising due to antigenic drift as well as individuals who cannot or choose not to take the vaccine. There is therefore an urgent need for additional therapies that complement vaccines and approved therapies such as antibodies in the fight to end or slow down the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 initiates invasion of the human target cell through direct contact between the receptor-binding domain of its Spike protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). The ACE2 and S1 RBD interaction, therefore, represents an attractive therapeutic intervention to prevent viral entry and spread. In this study, we developed a proximity-based AlphaScreen™ assay that can be utilized to quickly and efficiently screen for inhibitors that perturb the ACE2\\u2009:\\u2009S1 RBD interaction. We then designed several peptides candidates from motifs in ACE2 and S1 RBD that play critical roles in the interaction, with and without modifications to the native sequences. We also assessed the possibility of reprofiling of candidate small molecules that previously have been shown to interfere with the viral entry of SARS-CoV. Using our optimized AlphaScreen™ assay, we evaluated the activity and specificity of these peptides and small molecules in inhibiting the binding of ACE2\\u2009:\\u2009S1 RBD. This screen identified cepharanthine as a promising candidate for development as a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor.',\n",

Due to the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact, it is paramount to find effective treatments against it. Human neutralizing antibodies are an effective method to fight viral infection. However, the recent discovery of new strains that substantially change the S-protein sequence has raised concern about vaccines and antibodies' effectiveness. Here, using molecular simulations, we investigated the binding mechanisms between the S-protein and several antibodies. Multiple mutations were included to understand the strategies for antibody escape in new variants. We found that the combination of mutations K417N, E484K, L452R, and T478K produced higher binding energy to ACE2 than the wild type, suggesting higher efficiency to enter host cells. The mutations' effect depends on the antibody class. While Class I enhances the binding avidity in the presence of N501Y mutation, class II antibodies showed a sharp decline in the binding affinity. Our simulations suggest that Class I antibodies will remain effective against the new strains. In contrast, Class II antibodies will have less affinity to the S-protein, potentially affecting these antibodies' efficiency.\",\n",

A total of 8476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after a vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, Common CoV, and Influenza. Twenty-six percent of specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; out of 852 seropositive individuals 77 had symptoms and 9 sought medical care. The antibody response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length, and S2 domain of spike. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and not cross-reactive against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. A vaccination campaign at the University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC) started on December, 2020 and 6724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. Seroprevalence increased from 13% pre-vaccination to 79% post-vaccination in January, 93% in February, and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced higher antibody levels than natural exposure, especially against the RBD domain and cross-reactivity against SARS RBD and S1 was observed. Nucleocapsid protein antibodies can be used to distinguish vaccinees to classify pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Previously infected individuals developed higher antibody titers to the vaccine than non pre-exposed individuals. Hospitalized patients in intensive care with severe disease reach significantly higher antibody levels than mild cases, but lower antibody levels compared to the vaccine. These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much stronger and broader antibody response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

We demonstrate that a late viral isolate exhibiting genome mutations similar to those found in variants of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil, can escape neutralization by COVID-19 antisera. Moreover, infection of susceptible mice with this patient's escape variant elicits protective immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus and the escape variant, as well as high neutralization titers against the alpha and beta SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, demonstrating a considerable immune control against such variants of concern.

       "  'abstract': 'Extensive glycosylation of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus not only shields the major part of it from host immune responses, but glycans at specific sites also act on its conformation dynamics and contribute to efficient host receptor binding, and hence infectivity. As variants of concern arise during the course of the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic, it is unclear if mutations accumulated within the spike protein would affect its site-specific glycosylation pattern. The Alpha variant derived from the D614G lineage is distinguished from others by having deletion mutations located right within an immunogenic supersite of the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) that make it refractory to most neutralizing antibodies directed against this domain. Despite maintaining an overall similar structural conformation, our mass spectrometry-based site-specific glycosylation analyses of similarly produced spike proteins with and without the D614G and Alpha variant mutations reveal a significant shift in the processing state of N-glycans on one specific NTD site. Its conversion to a higher proportion of complex type structures is indicative of altered spatial accessibility attributable to mutations specific to the Alpha variant that may impact its transmissibility. This and other more subtle changes in glycosylation features detected at other sites provide crucial missing information otherwise not apparent in the available cryogenic electron microscopy-derived structures of the spike protein variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The current COVID-19 pandemic has heavily burdened the global public health system and may keep simmering for years. The frequent emergence of immune escape variants have spurred the search for prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies that confer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we show that the bivalency of an affinity maturated fully human single-domain antibody (n3113.1-Fc) exhibits exquisite neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, and confers effective prophylactic and therapeutic protection against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) humanized mice. The crystal structure of n3113 in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, combined with the cryo-EM structures of n3113 and spike ecto-domain, reveals that n3113 binds to the side surface of up-state RBD with no competition with ACE2. The binding of n3113 to this novel epitope stabilizes spike in up-state conformations but inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S mediated membrane fusion, expanding our recognition of neutralization by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Binding assay and pseudovirus neutralization assay show no evasion of recently prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) for n3113.1-Fc with Y58L mutation, demonstrating the potential of n3113.1-Fc (Y58L) as a promising candidate for clinical development to treat COVID-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 virus is rapidly evolving via mutagenesis, lengthening the pandemic, and threatening the public health. Until August 2021, 12 variants of SARS-CoV-2 named as variants of concern (VOC; Alpha to Delta) or variants of interest (VOI; Epsilon to Mu), with significant impact on transmissibility, morbidity, possible reinfection and mortality, have been identified. The VOC Delta (B.1.617.2) of Indian origin is now the dominant and the most contagious variant worldwide as it provokes a strong binding to the human ACE2 receptor, increases transmissibility and manifests considerable immune escape strategies after natural infection or vaccination. Although the development and administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, based on different technologies (mRNA, adenovirus carrier, recombinant protein, etc.), are very promising for the control of the pandemic, their effectiveness and neutralizing activity against VOCs varies significantly.

Virus spike protein-specific salivary IgA antibodies were significantly increased (P\\u2009=\\u2009.01) in infants fed breastmilk (0.99 arbitrary units [AU]; IQR, 0.39-1.68 AU) vs infants fed an exclusive formula diet (0.16 AU; IQR, 0.02-0.83 AU). Maternal milk contained IgA spike immune complexes at 48 hours (0.53 AU; IQR, 0.25-0.39 AU) and at 2 months (0.09 AU; IQR, 0.03-0.17 AU) and may have functioned as specific stimuli for the infant mucosal immune response.\\nIn this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgA antibodies were detected in infant saliva, which may partly explain why newborns are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this observational study of mucosal and systemic humoral immunity in acutely infected, convalescent, and vaccinated subjects, we tested for cross reactivity against endemic CoV spike (S) protein at subdomain resolution. Elevated responses, particularly to the β-CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross react. While further research is needed to discern whether this recalled response is desirable or detrimental, the boosted antibodies principally targeted the better conserved S2 subdomain of the viral spike and were not associated with neutralization activity. In contrast, vaccination with a stabilized spike mRNA vaccine did not robustly boost cross-reactive antibodies, suggesting differing antigenicity and immunogenicity. In sum, this study provides evidence that antibodies targeting endemic CoV are robustly boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not to vaccination with stabilized S, and that depending on conformation or other factors, the S2 subdomain of the spike protein triggers a rapidly recalled, IgG-dominated response that lacks neutralization activity.',\n",

These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race and/or ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serologic evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicago's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies.

Thereafter, we identified the baculovirus gp64 signal peptide-directed secretion of LV-MS1-Fc protein in the extracellular fluid.

The inoculated mice demonstrated a significant humoral immune response, measured via total IgG and neutralizing antibodies. In addition, human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) transgenic mice vaccinated with LV-MS1-Fc showed the protective capacity of LV-MS1-Fc against MERS-CoV with no inflammatory cell infiltration. These data showed that the S1 and Fc fusion protein induced potent humoral immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, and conferred protection against coronavirus viral challenge, indicating that LV-MS1-Fc is an effective vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) with resistance to neutralizing antibodies are threatening to undermine vaccine efficacy. Vaccination and infection have led to widespread humoral immunity against the pandemic founder (Wu-Hu-1). Against this background, it is critical to assess the outcomes of subsequent immunization with variant antigens. It is not yet clear whether heterotypic boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin, where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new one, or whether the memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs. We show, in macaques immunized with Wu-Hu-1 spike, that a single dose of adjuvanted beta variant receptor binding domain (RBD) protein broadens neutralizing antibody responses to heterologous VOCs. Passive transfer of plasma sampled after Wu-Hu-1 spike immunization only partially protects K18-hACE2 mice from lethal challenge with a beta variant isolate, whereas plasma sampled following heterotypic RBD boost protects completely against disease.',\n",

Here we report a PLA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate designed by combining a phage-derived virus-like particle carrying bacterial RNA as TLR ligands with the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S protein as the target antigen.

To address these issues, we used lentiviruses pseudotyped by variant spikes to measure their neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited and Regeneron therapeutic antibodies, and ACE2 affinity. Convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies neutralized viruses with Delta spike with 2- to 5-fold decrease in titer in different donors. Regeneron antibody cocktail neutralized virus with the Delta spike with a 2.6-fold decrease in titer. Neutralization resistance to serum antibodies and monoclonal antibodies was mediated by L452R mutation.

We employed three-stage random household sampling with a selection probability proportional to the subdistrict size, stratifying the subdistrict census-sampling frame by housing type and then selecting households from selected clusters. The survey started on 4 November 2020, 8 weeks after the end of the first wave (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test positivity had declined to <10% for the first wave) and coincided with the peak of the second wave. The last sampling was performed on 22 January 2021, which was 9 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 resurgence. Serum SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was measured using a quantitative assay on the Luminex platform.\\nFrom 6332 individuals in 3453 households, the overall RBD IgG seroprevalence was 19.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 18.1-20.1%] and similar in children and adults. The seroprevalence varied from 5.5% to 43.2% across subdistricts. Conservatively, there were 2 897 120 (95% CI: 2 743 907-3 056 866) SARS-CoV-2 infections, yielding an infection rate of 19 090 per 100 000 until 9 January 2021, when 330 336 COVID-19 cases were recorded. The estimated IFR using recorded COVID-19 deaths (n = 8198) was 0.28% (95% CI: 0.27-0.30) and 0.67% (95% CI: 0.64-0.71) assuming 90% of modelled natural excess deaths were due to COVID-19 (n = 21 582). Notably, 53.8% (65/122) of individuals with previous self-reported confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were RBD IgG seronegative.\\nThe calculated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 7.8-fold greater than the recorded COVID-19 cases. The calculated SARS-CoV-2 IFR varied 2.39-fold when calculated using reported COVID-19 deaths (0.28%) compared with excess-mortality-derived COVID-19-attributable deaths (0.67%). Waning RBD IgG may have inadvertently underestimated the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and conversely overestimated the mortality risk. Epidemic preparedness and response planning for future COVID-19 waves will need to consider the true magnitude of infections, paying close attention to excess-mortality trends rather than absolute reported COVID-19 deaths.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Coronaviruses are evolutionarily successful RNA viruses, common to multiple avian, amphibian and mammalian hosts. Despite their ubiquity and potential impact, knowledge of host immunity to coronaviruses remains incomplete, partly owing to the lack of overt pathogenicity of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), which typically cause common colds. However, the need for deeper understanding became pressing with the zoonotic introduction of three novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, causing severe acute respiratory syndromes in humans, and the unfolding pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This renewed interest not only triggered the discovery of two of the four HCoVs, but also uncovered substantial cellular and humoral cross-reactivity with shared or related coronaviral antigens. Here, we review the evidence for cross-reactive B cell memory elicited by HCoVs and its potential impact on the puzzlingly variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available data indicate targeting of highly conserved regions primarily in the S2 subunits of the spike glycoproteins of HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive B cells and antibodies. Rare monoclonal antibodies reactive with conserved S2 epitopes and with potent virus neutralising activity have been cloned, underscoring the potential functional relevance of cross-reactivity. We discuss B cell and antibody cross-reactivity in the broader context of heterologous humoral immunity to coronaviruses, as well as the limits of protective immune memory against homologous re-infection. Given the bidirectional nature of cross-reactivity, the unprecedented current vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 is expected to impact HCoVs, as well as future zoonotic coronaviruses attempting to cross the species barrier. However, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with resistance to neutralisation by vaccine-induced antibodies highlight a need for targeting more constrained, less mutable parts of the spike. The delineation of such cross-reactive areas, which humoral immunity can be trained to attack, may offer the key to permanently shifting the balance of our interaction with current and future coronaviruses in our favour.',\n",

We tested participants for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins using the Roche Elecsys immunoassays. We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence following vaccination and/or infection (anti-S antibodies), or infection only (anti-N antibodies).ResultsAmong 3,355 individuals (54.1% women; 20.8% aged\\u2009<\\u200918 years and 13.4% aged\\u2009≥\\u200965 years), 2,161 (64.4%) had anti-S antibodies and 906 (27.0%) had anti-N antibodies. The total seroprevalence was 66.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 64.1-68.0). We estimated that 29.9% (95% Crl: 28.0-31.9) of the population developed antibodies after infection; the rest having developed antibodies via vaccination. Seroprevalence estimates differed markedly across age groups, being lowest among children aged 0-5 years (20.8%; 95% Crl: 15.5-26.7) and highest among older adults aged\\u2009≥\\u200975 years (93.1%; 95% Crl: 89.6-96.0). Seroprevalence of antibodies developed via infection and/or vaccination was higher among participants with higher educational level.ConclusionMost of the population has developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, despite most teenagers and children remaining vulnerable to infection. As the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spreads and vaccination rates stagnate, efforts are needed to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among younger individuals and to minimise spread among children.',\n",

This study was performed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies within the domestic cat population in Istanbul, Turkey, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, from 155 cat sera analyzed, 26.45% (41/155) tested positive in the spike protein-ELISA (S-ELISA), 28.38% (44/155) in the receptor-binding domain-ELISA (RBD-ELISA), and 21.9% (34/155) in both, the S- and RBD-ELISAs. Twenty-seven of those were also positive for the presence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV). Among the 34 SARS-CoV-2-positive sera, three of those were positive on serum neutralization assay. Six of the 30 cats before COVID-19 and 28 of the 125 cats during COVID-19 were found to be seropositive. About 20% of ELISA-positive cats exhibited mainly respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal signs and skin lesions. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cells, lymphocyte, and platelet numbers were low in about 30% of ELISA-positive cats. The number of neutrophils and monocytes were above normal values in about 20% of ELISA-positive cats. The liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase levels were high in 23.5% ELISA-positive cats. In conclusion, this is the first report describing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S and RBD) in cats in Istanbul, Turkey, indicating the risk for domestic cats to contract SARS-CoV-2 from owners and/or household members with COVID-19. This study and others show that COVID-19-positive pet owners should limit their contact with companion animals and that pets with respiratory signs should be monitored for SARS-CoV-2 infections.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vaccination of the global population against COVID-19 is a great scientific, logistical, and moral challenge. Despite the rapid development and authorization of several full-length Spike (S) protein vaccines, the global demand outweighs the current supply and there is a need for safe, potent, high-volume, affordable vaccines that can fill this gap, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccines could fill this gap has been debated, especially with regards to its suitability to protect against emerging viral variants of concern. Given a predominance for elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target RBD following natural infection or vaccination, a key biomarker of protection, there is merit for selection of RBD as a sole vaccine immunogen. With its high-yielding production and manufacturing potential, RBD-based vaccines offer an abundance of temperature-stable doses at an affordable cost. In addition, as the RBD preferentially focuses the immune response to potent and recently recognized cross-protective determinants, this domain may be central to the development of future pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. In this study, we review the data supporting the non-inferiority of RBD as a vaccine immunogen compared to full-length S-protein vaccines with respect to humoral and cellular immune responses against both the prototype pandemic SARS-CoV-2 isolate and emerging variants of concern.',\n",

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM -CSF) has been proved to be effective in promoting lymphocyte regeneration, but adverse immunological effects have also emerged. This study aim to investigate the effect of GM -CSF on BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire while promoting lymphocyte regeneration. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and GM -CSF were used to inhibit and stimulate bone marrow hematopoiesis, respectively. High throughput sequencing was applied to detect the characteristics of BCR CDR3 repertoire in controls, CTX group and GM -CSF group. The white blood cells (WBCs) were quickly reduced (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) with lymphocytes decreasing causing by CTX, and the WBCs and lymphocytes returned to the level of controls after GM -CSF treatment. The diversity of BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire was also significantly decreased in CTX group. Although there is still a big gap from the controls, the diversity was picked up after GM -CSF treatment. The expression of IGHD01-01, IGHD02-14 and IGHJ04-01 with high-frequency usage regularly and significantly changed in three groups, and many genes with low-frequency usage lost in CTX group and did not reappear in GM -CSF group. Moreover, two shared sequences and accounted for the highest proportion in GM -CSF group have been detected in animal model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These results revealed that GM -CSF can partially restore changes in the BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire while promoting lymphocyte regeneration, but it may also lead to rearrangement, proliferation and activation of abnormal B cells, which can provide a basis for further study on the adverse immunological effects and mechanism of GM -CSF treatment.',\n",

However, the development of specific vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is not the only approach to control the virus and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) start to merit special attention as a therapeutic option to treat COVID-19 disease. Here, the main conformations and interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (S protein) with two mAbs (CR3022 and S309) and the ACE2 cell receptor are studied as the main representatives of three different epitopes on the RBD of S protein. The combined approach of 1 μs accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) and ab-initio hybrid molecular dynamics is used to identify the most predominant interactions under physiological conditions. Results allow to determine the main receptor-binding mapping, hydrogen bonding network and salt bridges in the most populated antigen-antibody interface conformations.

The results are presented in binding Ab units (BAU)/mL after application, when possible, of a conversion factor provided by the manufacturers and established from a World Health Organization internal standard. There was a 100% seroconversion with all assays evaluated after two doses of vaccine. With assays allowing BAU/mL correction, Ab titers were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, ρ, range: 0.85-0.94). The titer differences varied by a mean of 10.6% between Siemens and bioMérieux assays to 60.9% between Abbott and DiaSorin assays. These results underline the importance of BAU conversion for the comparison of Ab titer obtained with the different quantitative assays. However, significant differences persist, notably, between kits detecting Ab against the different antigens. A true standardization of the assays would be to include the International Standard in the calibration of each assay to express the results in IU/mL.',\n",

A monomeric form of Nsp9 is particularly important for RTC assembly and function. In the present study, 136 unique nanobodies targeting Nsp9 are generated. Several nanobodies belonging to different B-cell lineages are expressed, purified, and characterized. Results from immunoassays applied to purified Nsp9 and neat saliva from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients show that these nanobodies effectively and specifically recognize both recombinant and endogenous Nsp9. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses supported by molecular dynamics reveal a composite Nsp9 oligomerization pattern and demonstrate that both nanobodies stabilize the tetrameric form of wild-type Nsp9 also identifying the epitopes on the tetrameric assembly. These results can have important implications in the potential use of these nanobodies to combat viral replication.',\n",

Diagnostic tools and serological assays are critical for controlling the outbreak, especially assays designed to quantitate neutralizing antibody levels, considered the best correlate of protection. As vaccines become increasingly available, it is important to identify reliable methods for measuring neutralizing antibody responses that correlate with authentic virus neutralization but can be performed outside biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories. While many neutralizing assays using pseudotyped virus have been developed, there have been few studies comparing the different assays to each other as surrogates for authentic virus neutralization. Here, we characterized three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and three pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) neutralization assays and assessed their concordance with authentic virus neutralization. The most accurate assays for predicting authentic virus neutralization were luciferase- and secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)-expressing pseudotyped virus neutralizations, followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing pseudotyped virus neutralization, and then the ELISAs.

Sera from confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as unexposed individuals were applied to multicoronavirus arrays to identify specific antibody reactivity.

Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site.

CCP refers to plasma collected from donors who have recovered from and made antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To date, convalescent plasma has not been collected in South Africa. As other investigational therapies and vaccination were not widely accessible, there was an urgent need to implement a CCP manufacture programme to service South Africans.\\nThe South African National Blood Service and the Western Cape Blood Service implemented a CCP programme that included CCP collection, processing, testing and storage. CCP units were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA and neutralising antibodies and routine blood transfusion parameters. CCP units from previously pregnant females were tested for anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies.\\nA total of 987 CCP units were collected from 243 donors, with a median of three donations per donor. Half of the CCP units had neutralising antibody titres of >1:160. One CCP unit was positive on the TPHA serology. All CCP units tested for anti-HLA antibodies were positive.\\nWithin three months of the first COVID-19 diagnosis in South Africa, a fully operational CCP programme was set up across South Africa. The infrastructure and skills implemented will likely benefit South Africans in this and future pandemics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The evolution of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 at antigenic sites that impact neutralizing antibody responses in humans poses a risk to immunity developed through vaccination and natural infection. The highly successful RNA-based vaccines have enabled rapid vaccine updates that incorporate mutations from current variants of concern (VOCs). It is therefore important to anticipate future antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this goal, we survey epitope-paratope interfaces of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to map an antigenic space that captures the role of each spike protein residue within the polyclonal antibody response directed against the ACE2-receptor binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD). In particular, the antigenic space map builds on recently published epitope definitions by annotating epitope overlap and orthogonality at the residue level. We employ the antigenic space map as a framework to understand how mutations on nine major variants contribute to each variant's evasion of neutralizing antibodies. Further, we identify constellations of mutations that span the orthogonal epitope regions of the RBD and NTD on the variants with the greatest antibody escape. Finally, we apply the antigenic space map to predict which regions of antigenic space-should they mutate-may be most likely to complementarily augment antibody evasion for the most evasive and transmissible VOCs.\",\n",

In this study, we used a commercial anti-Spike immunoglobulin G (S-IgG) assay and developed a cell culture-based neutralization assay to understand the longitudinal course of neutralizing antibodies in both SARS-CoV2 infected or vaccinated individuals. We show that even more than one year after infection, about 78% of observed study participants remained seropositive concerning S-IgG antibodies. In addition, the serum of the individuals had stable neutralization capacity in a neutralization assay against a SARS-CoV-2 patient isolate from March 2020. We also examined volunteers after either homologous BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination or heterologous AZD1222 prime/mRNA-based booster vaccination. Both the heterologous and the homologous vaccination regimens induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in healthy subjects when compared to subjects after a mild infection, showing the high effectiveness of available vaccines. In addition, we could demonstrate the reliability of S-IgG levels in predicting neutralization capacity, with 94.8% of seropositive samples showing a neutralization titer of ≥10, making it a viable yet cheap and easy-to-determine surrogate parameter for neutralization capacity.',\n",

Despite having an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with a proofreading activity, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are on the rise periodically. Some of the mutations in these variants, especially mutations on the spike protein, aid the virus in transmission, infectivity and host immune evasion. Further, these mutations also reduce the effectiveness of some of the current vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In the present study, using the available 984,769 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences on the NCBI database from the end of 2019 till 28 July 2021, we have estimated the global prevalence of so-called 'adaptive mutations' and 'mutations identified in the prolonged infections', in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Irrespective of the geographical region, in the case of the adaptive mutations, N501Y (48.38%) was found to be the dominant mutation followed by L452R (17.52%), T478K (14.31%), E484K (4.69%), S477N (3.29%), K417T (1.64%), N439K (0.7%) and S494P (0.7%). Other mutations were found to be less prevalent (less than 0.7%). Since the last two months, there has been a massive increase of L452R and T478K mutations (delta variant) in certain areas. In the case of prolonged infections' mutations (long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections), V483A (0.009%) was found to be dominant followed by Q493R (0.009%), while other mutations were found in less than 0.007% of the studied sequences.

Antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are an important component of the neutralizing antibody response. In this work, we report that in a subset of patients-despite a decline in total S-specific antibodies-neutralizing antibody titers remain at a similar level for an average of 98 days in longitudinal sampling of a cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that 100% of seroconverting patients make detectable neutralizing antibody responses which can be quantified by a surrogate viral neutralization test. Examination of sera from ten out of the 59 subjects which received mRNA-based vaccination revealed that both IgG titers and neutralizing activity of sera were higher after vaccination compared to a cohort of 21 SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. One dose was sufficient for the induction of a neutralizing antibody, but two doses were necessary to reach 100% surrogate virus neutralization in subjects irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status. Like the pattern observed after natural infection, the total anti-S antibodies titers declined after the second vaccine dose; however, neutralizing activity remained relatively constant for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. Furthermore, our data indicates that-compared with mRNA vaccination-natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response in unexposed subjects. This work is an important contribution to understanding the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely impacted by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, by comparing the dynamics of the immune response after the natural infection vs. the vaccination, these findings suggest that functional neutralizing antibody tests are more relevant indicators than the presence or absence of binding antibodies.',\n",

Here, we analyze the production of the IgG antibodies to viral nucleocapsid (N) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and assess the serum neutralization capabilities in a cohort of patients with different levels of disease severity. In half of light or asymptomatic cases the antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein, which serve as the main target in many modern test systems, were not detected. They were detected in all cases of moderate or severe symptoms, and severe lung lesions correlated with respective higher signals. Antibodies to RBD were present in the absolute majority of samples, with levels being sometimes higher in light symptom cases. We thus suggest that the anti-RBD/anti-N antibody ratio may serve as an indicator of the disease severity. Anti-RBD IgG remained detectable after a year or more since the infection, even with a slight tendency to raise over time, and the respective signal correlated with the serum capacity to inhibit the RBD interaction with the ACE-2 receptor.',\n",

However, the precise molecular mechanism of this rare event is yet to be understood. Here, we hypothesize a potential anti-tumor immune response of SARS-CoV-2 and based on a computational approach show that: (i) SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD may bind to the extracellular domains of CD15, CD27, CD45, and CD152 receptors of cHL or FL and may directly inhibit cell proliferation. (ii) Alternately, upon internalization after binding to these CD molecules, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein and ORF3a may bind to gamma-tubulin complex component 3 (GCP3) at its tubulin gamma-1 chain (TUBG1) binding site. (iii) The M protein may also interact with TUBG1, blocking its binding to GCP3. (iv) Both the M and ORF3a proteins may render the GCP2-GCP3 lateral binding where the M protein possibly interacts with GCP2 at its GCP3 binding site and the ORF3a protein to GCP3 at its GCP2 interacting residues. (v) Interactions of the M and ORF3a proteins with these gamma-tubulin ring complex components potentially block the initial process of microtubule nucleation, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Partial mapping of N-reactive mAbs were conducted using truncated fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and revealed near complete coverage of the N protein.

The gland is a primary lymphoid organ responsible for generating mature T cells into CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells, contributing to cellular immunity. Regarding humoral immunity, the thymic plasma cells almost exclusively secrete IgG1 and IgG3, the two main complement-fixing effector IgG subclasses. Deformity in the thymus can lead to inflammatory diseases. Hassall's corpuscles' epithelial lining produces thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which induces differentiation of CDs thymocytes into regulatory T cells within the thymus medulla. Thymic B lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins and immunoregulating hormones, including thymosin. Modulation in T cell and naive T cells decrement due to thymus deformity induce alteration in the secretion of various inflammatory factors, resulting in multiple diseases. Influenza virus activates thymic CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes and a large amount of IFNγ. IFNs limit virus spread, enhance macrophages' phagocytosis, and promote the natural killer cell restriction activity against infected cells. Th2 lymphocytes-produced cytokine IL-4 can bind to antiviral INFγ, decreasing the cell susceptibility and downregulating viral receptors. COVID-19 epitopes (S, M, and N proteins) with ≥90% identity to the SARS-CoV sequence have been predicted. These epitopes trigger immunity for antibodies production.

Paired saliva and plasma samples were collected from 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors >14 days since PCR+ confirmed diagnosis. Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, and Cohen's kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4-92.1% and NPA: 69.2-91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9-100% and NPA: 50.0-84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6-96.6% and NPA: 50.0-100%. Compared to a plasma nAb assay, the multiplex salivary assay PPA ranged from 62.3% (N) and 98.6% (RBD) and NPA ranged from 18.8% (RBD) to 96.9% (S). Combinations of N, RBD, and S and a summary algorithmic index of all three (N/RBD/S) in saliva produced ranges of PPA: 87.6-98.9% and NPA: 50-91.7% with the three EIAs and ranges of PPA: 88.4-98.6% and NPA: 21.9-34.4% with the nAb assay.

To date, few treatment options exist, although neutralizing antibodies against the spike glycoprotein have proven to be effective. Because infection is initiated at the mucosa and propagates mainly at this site throughout the course of the disease, blocking the virus at the mucosal milieu should be effective. However, administration of biologics to the mucosa presents a substantial challenge. Here, we describe bifunctional molecules combining single-domain variable regions that bind to the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) and to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via addition of the ACE2 extracellular domain (ECD). The hypothesis behind this design is that pIgR will transport the molecule from the circulation to the mucosal surface where the ACE ECD would act as a decoy receptor for the nCoV2. The bifunctional molecules bind SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoprotein in vitro and efficiently transcytose across the lung epithelium in human tissue-based analyses. Designs featuring ACE2 tethered to the C-terminus of the Fc do not induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pIgR-expressing cells. These molecules thus represent a potential therapeutic modality for systemic administration of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules to the mucosa.',\n",

Similarly, B.1.1.7 readily infects wildtype rats with production of infectious virus particles.\\nOur study provides direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7, as well as other N501Y-carrying variants including B.1.351 and P.3, has gained the capability to expand species tropism to murines and public health measures including stringent murine control should be implemented to facilitate the control of the ongoing pandemic.\\nA full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section.',\n",

In this paper, we report on the generation of the receptor-binding domain RBD203-N1 yeast expression construct, which produces a recombinant protein capable of eliciting a robust immune response and protection in mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge infections. The RBD203-N1 antigen was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris X33. After fermentation at the 5\\xa0L scale, the protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity was evaluated in mice. Sera were evaluated for their efficacy using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay. The RBD203-N1 protein was expressed with a yield of 492.9\\xa0±\\xa03.0\\xa0mg/L of fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a >96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55\\xa0±\\xa03% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5\\xa0±\\xa013.2\\xa0mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized to be a homogeneous monomer that showed a well-defined secondary structure, was thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on Alhydrogel in the presence of CpG it was immunogenic and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The characteristics of the RBD203-N1 protein-based vaccine show that this candidate is another well suited RBD-based construct for technology transfer to manufacturing entities and feasibility of transition into the clinic to evaluate its immunogenicity and safety in humans.',\n",

New gene defects affecting the immune response continue to be reported, as many as 26 in the year 2020. It was noted that the presentation of IEIs might not include recurrent infections in 9% of cases, and that current diagnostic methods can identify molecular causes in 92% of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency. Progress in immunopathogenesis explained mechanisms leading to symptoms of autosomal-recessive hyper-IgE syndrome. There was an emphasis on research in primary antibody deficiencies. The benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of infections was demonstrated in these patients. The regimen of rituximab and azathioprine or mycophenolate was proven effective for chronic granulocytic interstitial pneumonia. The efficacy and adverse events of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in different IEI conditions were reported, as well as different strategies to improve outcomes, supporting its use in immunodeficiency and immunodysregulatory syndromes. The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 affected patients with IEIs, in particular those with deficiency in the interferon-mediated activation of the immune response.

Vaccination therapies use the same Spike sequence or protein to boost host immune response as a protective mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, cases of thrombotic events are reported following vaccination. Although vaccines are generally considered safe, due to genetic heterogeneity, age, or the presence of comorbidities in the population worldwide, the prediction of severe adverse outcome in patients remains a challenge. To elucidate Spike proteins underlying patient-specific-vascular thrombosis, the human microcirculation environment is recapitulated using a novel microfluidic platform coated with human endothelial cells and exposed to patient specific whole blood. Here, the blood coagulation effect is tested after exposure to Spike protein in nanoparticles and Spike variant D614G in viral vectors and the results are corroborated using live SARS-CoV-2.

Their defects in one or more essential functions for viral replication, particle assembly, or dissemination make them highly safe as vaccines. We previously showed that the deletion of the envelope (E) gene from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) produces a replication-competent propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-ΔE). Evaluation of this replicon in mice expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the virus receptor, showed that the single deletion of the E gene generated an attenuated mutant. The combined deletion of the E gene with accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 resulted in a highly attenuated propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E]). This RNA replicon induced sterilizing immunity in mice after challenge with a lethal dose of a virulent MERS-CoV, as no histopathological damage or infectious virus was detected in the lungs of challenged mice. The four mutants lacking the E gene were genetically stable, did not recombine with the E gene provided in trans during their passage in cell culture, and showed a propagation-defective phenotype in vivo. In addition, immunization with MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E] induced significant levels of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that MERS-CoV RNA replicons are highly safe and promising vaccine candidates.',\n",

BCEPS implements various machine learning models trained on a dataset including 555 linearized conformational B cell epitopes that were mined from antibody-antigen protein structures. The best performing model, based on a support vector machine, reached an accuracy of 75.38% ± 5.02.

In BCEPS, predicted epitopes can be ranked according to properties such as flexibility, accessibility and hydrophilicity, and with regard to immunogenicity, as judged by their predicted presentation by MHC II molecules. BCEPS also detects if predicted epitopes are located in ectodomains of membrane proteins and if they possess N-glycosylation sites hindering antibody recognition.

Our results, showing slow kinetics of antibody responses in MF patients following vaccination with mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, support the need for a third vaccine dose.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reached an unprecedented level. There is a strong demand for diagnostic and serological supplies worldwide, making it necessary for countries to establish their own technologies to produce high-quality biomolecules. The two main viral antigens used for the diagnostics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are the structural proteins spike (S) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into S1 and S2, in which the S1 subunit has the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, whereas nucleocapsid is an ideal target for viral antigen-based detection. In this study, we designed plasmids, pcDNA3.1/S1 and pcDNA3.1/N, and optimized their expression of the recombinant S1 and N proteins from SARS-CoV-2 in a mammalian system. The RBD was used as a control. The antigens were successfully purified from Expi293 cells, with high yields of the S1, N, and RBD proteins. The immunogenic abilities of these proteins were demonstrated in a mouse model. Further, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with human serum samples showed that the SARS-CoV-2 antigens are a suitable alternative for serological assays to identify patients infected with COVID-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibody (NAb) production is a crucial humoral response that can reduce re-infection or breakthrough infection. The conventional test used to measure NAb production capacity levels is the live virus-neutralizing assay. However, this test must be conducted under biosafety level-3 containment. Pseudovirus or surrogate NAb tests, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition tests, can be performed under level-2 containment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a surrogate SARS-CoV-2 NAb assay (sNAb) using samples from naturally infected individuals and vaccine recipients in comparison with the live virus microneutralization assay (vMN). Three hundred and eighty serum samples which were collected from 197 patients with COVID-19, 96 vaccine recipients and 84 normal individuals were analyzed. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the sNAb (iFlash-2019-NAb assay, Shenzhen, China) were 97.9%, 94.9%, 98.2%, and 93.8%, respectively. Agreement for the assay relative to vMN for naturally infected individuals and vaccine recipients were 98.5% and 93.9%, respectively. A correlation analysis between sNAb and the vMN for both of these groups yielded an R2 value of 0.83. The iFlash RBD NAb assay is found to be sensitive and reliable for neutralizing antibody measurement in patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease and those who have been vaccinated against it.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe COVID-19 is often accompanied by coagulopathies such as thrombocytopenia and abnormal clotting. Rarely, such complications follow SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The cause of these coagulopathies is unknown. It is hypothesized that coagulopathies accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations result from bacterial co-infections that synergize with virus-induced autoimmunity due to antigenic mimicry of blood proteins by both bacterial and viral antigens. Coagulopathies occur mainly in severe COVID-19 characterized by bacterial co-infections with Streptococci, Staphylococci, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. These bacteria express unusually large numbers of antigens mimicking human blood antigens, as do both SARS-CoV-2 and adenoviruses. Bacteria mimic cardiolipin, prothrombin, albumin, and platelet factor 4 (PF4). SARS-CoV-2 mimics complement factors, Rh antigens, platelet phosphodiesterases, Factors IX and X, von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and VWF protease ADAMTS13. Adenoviruses mimic prothrombin and platelet factor 4. Bacterial prophylaxis, avoidance of vaccinating bacterially infected individuals, and antigen deletion for vaccines may reduce coagulopathy risk.

       "  'abstract': 'Receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion are essential for the establishment of successful infection by SARS-CoV-2. Halting these steps can cure COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse events when administrated with 10 times the effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to the ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the receptor binding domain, possibly interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results suggest that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19.',\n",

High-throughput, highly flexible methods for characterization are of great benefit to the development of liposomes featuring surface proteins. DNA-directed patterning is one such method that offers versatility in immobilizing and segregating lipid-based nanoparticles for subsequent analysis. Here, oligonucleotides are selectively conjugated onto a glass substrate and then hybridized to complementary oligonucleotides tagged to liposomes, patterning them with great control and precision. The power of DNA-directed patterning is demonstrated by characterizing a novel recapitulative lipid-based nanoparticle model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-S-liposomes-that presents the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on its surface. Patterning a mixture of S-liposomes and liposomes that display the tetraspanin CD63 to discrete regions of a substrate shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) specifically binds to S-liposomes. Subsequent introduction of S-liposomes to ACE2-expressing cells tests the biological function of S-liposomes and shows agreement with DNA-directed patterning-based assays. Finally, multiplexed patterning of S-liposomes verifies the performance of commercially available neutralizing antibodies against the two S variants.

       "  'abstract': 'Patients receiving dialysis are a sentinel population for groups at high risk for death and disability from COVID-19. Understanding correlates of protection post-vaccination can inform immunization and mitigation strategies.\\nMonthly since January 2021, we tested plasma from 4791 patients receiving dialysis for antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using a high-throughput assay. We qualitatively assessed the proportion without a detectable RBD response and among those with a response, semiquantitative median IgG index values. Using a nested case-control design, we matched each breakthrough case to five controls by age, sex, and vaccination-month to determine whether peak and pre-breakthrough RBD IgG index values were associated with risk for infection post-vaccination.\\nAmong 2563 vaccinated patients, the proportion without a detectable RBD response increased from 6.6% [95% CI 5.5-8.1] in 14-30 days post-vaccination to 20.2% [95% CI 17.1-23.8], and median index values declined from 92.7 (95% CI 77.8-107.5) to 3.7 (95% CI 3.1-4.3) after 5 months. Persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection prior-to-vaccination had higher peak index values than persons without prior infection, but values equalized by 5 months (p=0.230). Breakthrough infections occurred in 56 patients, with samples collected a median of 21 days pre-breakthrough. Peak and pre-breakthrough RBD values <23 (equivalent to <506 WHO BAU/mL) were associated with higher odds for breakthrough infection (OR: 3.7 [95% CI 2.0-6.8] and 9.8 [95% CI 2.9-32.8], respectively).\\nThe antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination wanes rapidly, and in persons receiving dialysis, the persisting antibody response is associated with risk for breakthrough infection.',\n",

Among those tests, a test for the neutralizing ability of an antibody is crucial for assessment of population immunity gained through vaccination, and to test therapeutic value of antibodies made to counter the infections. Here, we report a sensitive technique to detect the relative neutralizing strength of various antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used bright, photostable, background-free, fluorescent upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a phantom virion. A glass bottom plate coated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein imitates the target cells. When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the particles would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a neutralizing antibody can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated substrate. A prototype system consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope was used to quantify particle attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of this assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2 {\\\\mu}g/ml. This is to be compared to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially available kits.',\n",

The objective of our study was to analyze the level of specific humoral and cellular T-cell responses against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced by two mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), but also how long it takes after vaccination to induce these protective humoral and cellular immune responses.\\nWe studied in 40 healthy (not previously infected) volunteers vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines the presence of spike-specific IgG antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells at 3, 7 and 14 days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. The specific T-cell response was analyzed stimulating fresh whole blood from vaccinated volunteers with SARS-CoV-2 peptides and measuring the release of cytokines secreted by T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 stimulation.\\nOur results indicate that the immunization capacity of both vaccines is comparable. However, although both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines can induce early B-cell and T-cell responses, these vaccine-mediated immune responses do not reach their maximum values until 14 days after completing the vaccination schedule.\\nThis refractory period in the induction of specific immunity observed after completing the vaccination could constitute a window of higher infection risk, which could explain some emerging cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated people.',\n",

While HD generated Spike-specific memory B-cells, and RBD-specific B-cells, CVID generated Spike-specific atypical B-cells, while RBD-specific B-cells were undetectable in all patients, indicating the incapability to generate this new specificity.

We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies.

       "  'abstract': 'Wide-scale assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies is critical to understanding population seroprevalence, correlates of protection, and the longevity of vaccine-elicited responses. Most SARS-CoV-2 studies characterize antibody responses in plasma/sera. While reliable and broadly used, these samples pose several logistical restrictions, such as requiring venipuncture for collection and a cold chain for transportation and storage. Dried blood spots (DBS) overcome these barriers as they can be self-collected by fingerstick and mailed and stored at ambient temperature. Here, we evaluate the suitability of DBS for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by comparing several antibody responses between paired plasma and DBS from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We found that DBS not only reflected plasma antibody binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and epitope profiles using phage display, but also yielded SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers that highly correlated with paired plasma. Neutralization measurement was further streamlined by adapting assays to a high-throughput 384-well format. This study supports the adoption of DBS for numerous SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization assays. ',\n",

The aim of this study was to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand via a nationwide serosurvey of blood donors. Samples (n = 9806) were collected over a month-long period (3 December 2020-6 January 2021) from donors aged 16-88 years. The sample population was geographically spread, covering 16 of 20 district health board regions. A series of Spike-based immunoassays were utilised, and the serological testing algorithm was optimised for specificity given New Zealand is a low prevalence setting. Eighteen samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, six of which were retrospectively matched to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases. A further four were from donors that travelled to settings with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, suggesting likely infection outside New Zealand. The remaining eight seropositive samples were from seven different district health regions for a true seroprevalence estimate, adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity, of 0.103% (95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.12%). The very low seroprevalence is consistent with limited undetected community transmission and provides robust, serological evidence to support New Zealand's successful elimination strategy for COVID-19.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is hypothesized that several comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Cardiovascular disease including hypertension was shown to play a critical role in the severity of COVID-19 infection by affecting the survival of patients with COVID-19. Hypertension and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are involved in increasing vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (ED), and both processes are instrumental in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the target receptor that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry to the cell. This led to speculations that major renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, such as angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might affect the course of the disease, since their administration enhances angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 expression. An increase in ACE2 activity could reduce angiotensin II concentration in the lungs and mitigate virus-driven lung injury. This could also be associated with a reduction in blood coagulation, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; of note, COVID-19 is now regarded as a disorder of blood clotting. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the effect of targeting ACE2 as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 driven injury, and in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms by reversing SARS-CoV-2-induced excessive coagulation and fatalities. Ongoing therapeutic strategies that include recombinant human ACE2 and anti-spike monoclonal antibodies are essential for future clinical practice in order to better understand the effect of targeting ED in COVID-19.',\n",

A total of 1053 healthcare workers who were initially seronegative (COV2T® SARS-CoV-2 Total Siemens, USA) and vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study. Quantitative IgG antibodies (ADVIA Centaur® SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens, USA) were investigated 28 days after the first vaccine (n= 939) and the second vaccine (n= 771). In addition, neutralizing antibodies were evaluated via \"enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\" test (ACE2-RBD Neutralization Assay, Dia-Pro, Italy) 28 days after the first vaccine. Antibody response of the vaccine was evaluated statistically by univariate (Chi-square, Fisher\\'s exact test, Student\\'s t test, Mann-Whitney U, one-way ANOVA and Kruskall Wallis ANOVA tests) analysis and linear regression models. The consistency between quantitative IgG test and neutralizing antibody test was also evaluated in blood samples taken 28 days after second vaccination. Statistical analysis was determined in logarithmically transformed data with statistical analysis with SPSS 23.0 and Stata, and type 1 error level was accepted as 0.05. At least one side effect was reported by 31.3% and 26.8% of the participants after the first and second vaccine, respectively. The most frequent side effect was pain at the injection site with a frequency of 20.4% vs 21.7%. The frequency of applying to a health center due to side effects was 1.0% after the first vaccine and 0.8% after the second vaccine. The percentage of those who produced sufficient quantitative IgG was found as 25.3% (95% CI= 22.5-28.1) 28 days after the first vaccine and 97.9% (95% CI= 96.91- 98.93) after the second vaccine. Neutralizing test antibody positivity was found as 97.7% 28 days after the second vaccine. In univariate analysis, the characteristics that significantly increased the quantitative IgG response against inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were young age (p<0.01), female gender (p<0.01), being a non smoker (p<0.001), not having a chronic disease (p= 0.019), having had the flu vaccine this year (p= 0.012), not being overweight or obese (p= 0.020), and having a SARS-CoV2 infection prior to vaccination (p<0.001). In addition, allied health personnel showed significantly lower antibody responses than the other workers (p<0.001). Multiple linear regression models revealed that, female gender, younger age, smoking and previous COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test positivity significantly affected the quantitative IgG response after vaccination. A 99% agreement was found between the ELISA-based neutralizing antibody test and the quantitative IgG test (Kappa p= 0.783) performed on the 28th day after the second vaccination. CoronaVac® provides adequate antibody response in 25% of healthcare workers aged 18-64, after 28 days from a single vaccine, and 97% after 28 days from the second vaccine. Antibody response was significantly higher in younger ages, women, non-smokers, and those who had previously encountered SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we combine atomistic simulations with the ensemble-based mutational profiling of binding for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexes with a wide range of nanobodies to identify dynamic and binding affinity fingerprints and characterize the energetic determinants of nanobody-escaping mutations. Using an in silico mutational profiling approach for probing the protein stability and binding, we examine dynamics and energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with single nanobodies Nb6 and Nb20, VHH E, a pair combination VHH E + U, a biparatopic nanobody VHH VE, and a combination of the CC12.3 antibody and VHH V/W nanobodies. This study characterizes the binding energy hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 protein and complexes with nanobodies providing a quantitative analysis of the effects of circulating variants and escaping mutations on binding that is consistent with a broad range of biochemical experiments. The results suggest that mutational escape may be controlled through structurally adaptable binding hotspots in the receptor-accessible binding epitope that are dynamically coupled to the stability centers in the distant binding epitope targeted by VHH U/V/W nanobodies. This study offers a plausible mechanism in which through cooperative dynamic changes, nanobody combinations and biparatopic nanobodies can elicit the increased binding affinity response and yield resilience to common escape mutants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has necessitated the rapid development of antibody-based therapies and vaccines as countermeasures. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize two protective anti-SARS-CoV-2 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in complex with the spike protein, revealing similarities between epitopes targeted by human and murine B cells. The more neutralizing mAb, 2B04, binds the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and competes with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By contrast, 2H04 binds adjacent to the RBM and does not compete for ACE2 binding. Naturally occurring sequence variants of SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding neutralization escape variants selected in\\xa0vitro map to our structurally defined epitopes, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might evade therapeutic antibodies with a limited set of mutations, underscoring the importance of combination mAb therapeutics. Finally, we show that 2B04 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventing ACE2 engagement, whereas 2H04 reduces host cell attachment without directly disrupting ACE2-RBM interactions, providing distinct inhibitory mechanisms used by RBD-specific mAbs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 vaccine design and vaccination rollout need to take into account a detailed understanding of antibody durability and cross-neutralizing potential against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOCs). Analyses of convalescent sera provide unique insights into antibody longevity and cross-neutralizing activity induced by variant spike proteins, which are putative vaccine candidates. Using sera from 38 individuals infected in wave 1, we show that cross-neutralizing activity can be detected up to 305 days pos onset of symptoms, although sera were less potent against B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B1.351 (Beta). Over time, despite a reduction in overall neutralization activity, differences in sera neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Beta variants decreased, which suggests that continued antibody maturation improves tolerance to spike mutations. We also compared the cross-neutralizing activity of wave 1 sera with sera from individuals infected with the Alpha, the Beta or the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants up to 79 days post onset of symptoms. While these sera neutralize the infecting VOC and parental virus to similar levels, cross-neutralization of different SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages is reduced. These findings will inform the optimization of vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum are found unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization.

Then, global RBD alanine scanning with a panel of 19 selected neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including several broadly reactive NAbs, was performed. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of single natural mutation or co-mutations of concern at key positions of RBD on the neutralization escape and ACE2 binding function by recombinant proteins and pseudoviruses.\\nThirty-three amino acid positions within four independent antigenic sites (1 to 4) of RBD were identified as valuable indicators of antigenic changes in the RBD. The comprehensive escape mutation map not only confirms the widely circulating strains carrying important immune escape RBD mutations such as K417N, E484K, and L452R, but also facilitates the discovery of new immune escape-enabling mutations such as F486L, N450K, F490S, and R346S. Of note, these escape mutations could not affect the ACE2 binding affinity of RBD, among which L452R even enhanced binding. Furthermore, we showed that RBD co-mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y present in B.1.351 appear more resistant to NAbs and human convalescent plasma from the\\xa0early stage of the pandemic, possibly due to an additive effect. Conversely, double mutations E484Q and L452R present in B.1.617.1 variant show partial antibody evasion with no evidence for an additive effect.\\nOur study provides a global view of the determinants for neutralizing antibody recognition, antigenic conservation, and RBD conformation. The in-depth escape maps may have value for prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 immune escape variants.

The reference test for the anti-spike neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) ability to counteract the viral infection is the virus neutralization test (VNT). Great interest is developing on reliable serological assays allowing antibodies concentration and antibody protective titer correlation. The aim of our study was to detect nAbs serum levels in paucisymptomatic, symptomatic and vaccinated subjects, to find a cut-off value able to protect from virus infection. nAbs serum levels were detected by a competitive automated immunoassay, in association to VNT with the SARS-CoV-2 original and British variant strains. The median nAbs concentrations were: 281.3 BAU/ml for paucisymptomatics; 769.4 BAU/ml for symptomatics; 351.65 BAU/ml for the vaccinated cohort; 983 BAU/ml considering only the second dose vaccinated individuals. The original strain VNT analysis showed 1:80 median neutralization titers in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated subjects; 1:160 in symptomatic patients; 1:160 in the second dose groups. The British variant VNT analysis showed lower neutralization titers in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated groups (1:40); the same titer in symptomatic patients (1:160); the second dose group confirmed the original strain titer (1:160). In conclusion, our data showed optimal correlations with a proportional increase between neutralizing activity and antibody concentration, making nAbs detection a good alternative to virus neutralization assays, difficult to carry out in routine laboratories. Finally, ROC curve analysis established a cut-off of 408.6 BAU/ml to identify subjects with a low risk of infection.',\n",

Cross-reactive antibody responses have been seen in previous variants of SARS and SARS-CoV-2, but little is known about the cross reactivity with other similar RNA viruses like HIV-1. In the present study, we examined the reactivity the SARS-CoV-2 directed antibodies, via spike, immunized mice sera and demonstrated whether they conferred any cross-reactive neutralization against HIV-1. Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 spike immunized mice antibodies cross-react with the HIV-1 Env protein. Cross-neutralization among the two viruses is uncommon, suggesting the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes amongst the two viruses. Our results indicate, that SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody cross reactivity is targeted towards the gp41 region of the HIV-1 Env (gp160) protein. Overall, our investigation not only answers a crucial question about the understanding of cross-reactive epitopes of antibodies generated in different viral infections, but also provides critical evidence for developing vaccine immunogens and novel treatment strategies with enhanced efficacy capable of recognising diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features.',\n",

However, a very small number of patients suffer severe Coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). The reasons underlying these different outcomes remain unknown.\\nWe analyzed three different cohorts: children with acute infection (n=550), convalescent children (n=138), and MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, n=42). IgG and IgM antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, serum-neutralizing activity, plasma cytokine levels, and the frequency of circulating Follicular T helper cells (cTfh) and plasmablasts were analyzed by conventional methods.\\nFifty-eight percent of the children in the acute phase of infection had no detectable antibodies at the time of sampling while a seronegative status was found in 25% and 12% of convalescent and MIS-C children, respectively. When children in the acute phase of the infection were stratified according disease severity, we found that contrasting with the response of children with asymptomatic, mild and moderate disease, children with severe COVID-19 did not develop any detectable response. A defective antibody response was also observed in the convalescent cohort for children with severe disease at the time of admission. This poor antibody response was associated to both, a low frequency of cTfh and a high plasma concentration of inflammatory cytokines.\\nA weak and delayed kinetic of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 together with a systemic pro-inflammatory profile characterize pediatric severe COVID-19. Because comorbidities are highly prevalent in children with severe COVID-19, further studies are needed to clarify their contribution in the weak antibody response observed in severe disease.\\nNational Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion from Argentina (IP-COVID-19-0277 and PMO-BID-PICT2018-2548).',\n",

While vaccines are now available, they do not work for everyone and therapeutic drugs are still needed, particularly for treating life-threatening conditions. Here, we showed nasal delivery of a new, unmodified camelid single-domain antibody (VHH), termed K-874A, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 titers in infected lungs of Syrian hamsters without causing weight loss and cytokine induction. In vitro studies demonstrated that K-874A neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in both VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and human lung-derived alveolar organoid cells. Unlike other drug candidates, K-874A blocks viral membrane fusion rather than viral attachment. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed K-874A bound between the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain of the virus S protein. Further, infected cells treated with K-874A produced fewer virus progeny that were less infective. We propose that direct administration of K-874A to the lung could be a new treatment for preventing the reinfection of amplified virus in COVID-19 patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has cost millions of lives and tremendous social/financial loss. The virus continues to evolve and mutate. In particular, the recently emerged \"UK\", \"South Africa\", and Delta variants show higher infectivity and spreading speed. Thus, the relationship between the mutations of certain amino acids and the spreading speed of the virus is a problem of great importance. In this respect, understanding the mutational mechanism is crucial for surveillance and prediction of future mutations as well as antibody/vaccine development. In this work, we used a coarse-grained model (that was used previously in predicting the importance of mutations of N501) to calculate the free energy change of various types of single-site or combined-site mutations. This was done for the UK, South Africa, and Delta mutants. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the binding affinity changes for mutations at different spike protein domains of SARS-CoV-2 and provided the energy basis for the resistance of the E484 mutant to the antibody m396. Other potential mutation sites were also predicted. Furthermore, the in silico predictions were assessed by functional experiments. The results establish that the faster spreading of recently observed mutants is strongly correlated with the binding-affinity enhancement between virus and human receptor as well as with the reduction of the binding to the m396 antibody. Significantly, the current approach offers a way to predict new variants and to assess the effectiveness of different antibodies toward such variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The newly emerging Kappa, Delta, and Lambda SARS-CoV-2 variants are worrisome, characterized with the double mutations E484Q/L452R, T478K/L452R, and F490S/L452Q, respectively, in their receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the spike proteins. As revealed in crystal structures, most of these residues (e.g., 452 and 484 in RBDs) are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, these mutations might not significantly affect RBD's binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without knowing the molecular mechanism, these successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) may be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, here, we show that the E484Q/L452R mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between the RBD of the Kappa variant and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab), which was efficacious for neutralizing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. To verify simulation results, we further carried out experiments with both pseudovirions- and live virus-based neutralization assays and demonstrated that LY-CoV555 completely lost neutralizing activity against the L452R/E484Q mutant. Similarly, we show that mutations in the Delta and Lambda variants can also destabilize the RBD's binding with LY-CoV555. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how these variants evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precise mixing of antibodies can be achieved as a cocktail treatment for patients infected with these variants.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerging of coronavirus, continues to infect humans in the absence of a viable treatment. Neutralizing antibodies that disrupt the interaction of RBD and ACE2 has been under the spotlight as a way of developing the COVID-19 treatment. Some animals, such as llamas, manufacture heavy-chain antibodies that have a single variable domain (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH/VL) as opposed to typical antibodies. Nanobodies are antigen-specific, single-domain, changeable segments of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies that are recombinantly produced. These types of antibodies exhibit a wide range of strong physical and chemical properties, like high solubility, and stability. The VHH's high-affinity attachment to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) allowed the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. To tackle COVID-19, some nanobodies are being developed against SARS-CoV-2, some of which have been recently included in clinical trials. Nanobody therapy may be useful in managing the COVID-19 pandemic as a potent and low-cost treatment. This paper describes the application of nanobodies as a new class of recombinant antibodies in COVID-19 treatment.\",\n",

Using this stringent transgenic model, we demonstrated that a non-integrative lentiviral vector, encoding for the spike glycoprotein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2, used in intramuscular prime and intranasal boost elicits sterilizing protection of lung and brain against both the ancestral virus, and the Gamma (P.1) variant of concern, which carries multiple vaccine escape mutations.

RBD amino acid mutations comprising K417T/N, L452R, Y453F, S477N, E484K, and N501Y cause significant immune escape from 11 of 13 monoclonal antibodies. However, the resistance to neutralization by convalescent serum or vaccines elicited serum is mainly caused by the E484K mutation. The convalescent serum from B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-infected patients neutralized the variants themselves better than other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our study provides insights regarding therapeutic antibodies and vaccines, and highlights the importance of E484K mutation.',\n",

Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential escape mutations by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue.\\nIndividuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination.\\nThe finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.\\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI138709 (PI Overbaugh) and AI146028 (PI Matsen).

Early in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Argentinean Biobank of Infectious Diseases (BBEI) initiated the COVID19 collection and started its characterization. Blood samples from subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection either admitted to health institutions or outpatients, were enrolled. Highly exposed seronegative individuals, were also enrolled. Longitudinal samples were obtained in a subset of donors, including persons who donated plasma for therapeutic purposes (plasma donors). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels, IgG titers and IgG viral neutralization capacity were determined. Out of 825 donors, 57.1% were females and median age was 41 years (IQR 32-53 years). Donors were segregated as acute or convalescent donors, and mild versus moderate/severe disease donors. Seventy-eight percent showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Specific IgM and IgG showed comparable positivity rates in acute donors. IgM detectability rate declined in convalescent donors while IgG detectability remained elevated in early (74,8%) and late (83%) convalescent donors. Among donors with follow-up samples, IgG levels seemed to decline more rapidly in plasma donors. IgG levels were higher with age, disease severity, number of symptoms, and more durable in moderate/severe disease donors. Levels and titers of anti-spike/RBD IgG strongly correlated with neutralization activity against WT virus. The BBEI-COVID19 collection serves a dual role in this SARS-CoV-2 global crisis. First, it feeds researchers and developers transferring samples and data to fuel research projects.

       "  'abstract': \"The importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution cannot be overemphasized. Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is vaccinated. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.\",\n",

The Fc moiety is designed to enhance immunogenicity by increasing uptake via Fc-receptors (FcγR) on Ag-presenting cells (APCs) and prolonging exposure due to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling.

       "  'abstract': 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a devastating effect on public health and the world economy. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, with the majority of transmission occurring from close contact with presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic carriers. Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been considerable progress in the management of COVID-19 with the development of novel therapeutics and highly efficacious vaccines that have led to favorable patient outcomes and has limited the spread of the virus. A variety of therapeutic options are currently available in the management of COVID-19, including antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents. However, the therapeutic potential and clinical use of these drugs are limited and are specific to the stage of the illness. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness occurs in two distinct phases, an early stage characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication followed by a late phase characterized by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and activation of the coagulation system resulting in a prothrombotic state. Antiviral therapy and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective if used during the early phase of the illness. Immunomodulating therapies, either alone or in combination with antiviral and antibody-based therapies, may be more effective when used in the later stage to combat the cytokine-mediated hyperinflammatory state that causes severe illness.[1] Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection and severe disease. However, individuals aged ≥60 years and with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the CDC during January 22\\xa0to May 30, 2020.[2]\\xa0 A promising approach to address the COVID-19 associated mortality and preventing the increased utilization of healthcare resources is by terminating the progression of viral replication preventing the progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19, which causes severe illness in high-risk nonhospitalized patients. Initially, the focus of treatment was directed mainly towards hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness. However, the clinical focus throughout the pandemic expanded towards combatting the illness early on by reducing the viral load in patients with early disease, thus attempting to halt the disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 have yielded positive in vitro results.[3][4]\\xa0They are considered a promising approach in managing nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins developed from a single cell lineage that demonstrate a high affinity for their target cell. Monoclonal antibodies were first developed by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 using hybridoma technology.[5] Since then, significant progress has been made in the molecular engineering world that has enabled the establishment of monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapies in various neoplastic conditions, autoimmune, post-transplant immunosuppression, and infectious diseases.[6]\\xa0When used as antiviral therapies, neutralizing antibodies play an indispensable part in achieving passive antiviral immunity and are also instrumental in preventing or regulating many viral illnesses. Over the years, passive immunization against many viral diseases was achieved by administering polyclonal sera obtained from convalescent human donors or animals. However, polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by monoclonal antibodies because they demonstrate a favorable safety profile and target specificity when used in different viral diseases.[7]\\xa0Palivizumab was the first antiviral monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants.[8]\\xa0 Over the years, significant developments in antibody engineering, improved understanding of the biology of viruses, and the direct and indirect effect of monoclonal antibodies on viral infections has resulted in many novel monoclonal antibodies. Like other antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, when used as antiviral agents, are also susceptible to developing resistance as a result of alterations in the viral genome which can alter the pathogenic potential of the virus resulting in the emergence of viral escape mutants, which may render the virus-resistant to a specific monoclonal antibody. To counter this viral escape phenomenon, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as antibody cocktails, have been proposed with the rationale that combining two specific monoclonal antibodies that complement each other can prevent neutralization escape by targeting multiple viral epitopes. Various monoclonal antibodies are currently in development or clinical trials to treat COVID-19. Currently, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for clinical use of casirivimab plus imdevimab as combination therapy,\\xa0bamlanivimab plus etesivimab as combination therapy, or sotrovimab monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are at high risk of developing severe disease. Additionally, the FDA has granted EUAs authorizing the use of casirivimab plus imdevimab and bamlanivimab plus etesivimab for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of COVID-19 in specific adult and pediatric individuals. This review article briefly discusses the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, indications for the use of monoclonal antibody therapy, and evaluating and referring patients for monoclonal antibody therapy in the emergency department if they present with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and are at high risk of developing severe illness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted\\xa0the world tremendously since the first cases were identified in 2019. COVID-19 was rapidly disseminated globally, with infections identified in most world societies within the first few months of 2020. COVID-19, the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had devastating effects on public health and the world economy. In the United States, the earliest and most well-documented areas impacted were large cities and urban communities. Initial efforts to curb the transmission of COVID-19 were largely successful in helping stem continued widespread transmission. As vaccinations for COVID-19 began rollout, authorities eased some of the initial transmission mitigation strategies, and coupled with the increased prominence of COVID-19 variant strains, transmission and infection rates saw an increase throughout the spring and summer of 2021. Despite their lower population density, rural and underserved areas continue to be especially vulnerable to poor outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. The disparity in healthcare outcomes in\\xa0these\\xa0areas is multifactorial. In general, rural and underserved\\xa0healthcare infrastructure is less developed than its urban counterparts.[1]\\xa0These residents often have significantly increased distances\\xa0to travel to access advanced health care facilities. The travel gap often leads to residents not seeking care until the disease has reached advanced stages. Concerning rural and underserved patients, this distance affects all diseases, with cancer often being found after metastasis, diabetes after end-organ dysfunction, hypertension after a stroke or heart attack, and COVID-19 after pneumonia and subsequent hypoxia develop. Additionally, in rural and underserved areas, patient demographics (i.e., tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and older age) often\\xa0fall in categories associated with a higher risk of mortality and morbidity from SARS-CoV-2 infection. From a resource standpoint, rural areas have limited availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and access to novel medications through clinical trials. Furthermore, rural communities have always been especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, and the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic exposed some\\xa0fragilities in our national supply chain.\\xa0A nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing devices (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs, reagents, and test kits), and respiratory ventilators plagued initial efforts to combat COVID-19.[2] The acute shortage of testing devices made it neither practical nor beneficial to promote universal screening for COVID-19 in rural areas. Perhaps even more disparate, as a country,\\xa0the USA is experiencing a shortage of trained nurses, allied health providers, and physicians, and\\xa0rural communities are often the most challenged in providing adequate numbers of health care professionals and, in particular, sub-specialist physicians to care for their residents.[3] SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, with most transmission occurring from close contact with pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic carriers. Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), considerable progress has been made in managing COVID-19 with the development of novel therapeutics and efficacious vaccines that have led to favorable patient outcomes and has helped limit the spread of the virus. A variety of therapeutic options are currently available in the management of COVID-19, including antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents. However, the therapeutic potential and clinical use of these drugs are limited and are specific to the stage of the illness. Further, rural areas have limited resources to provide access to monoclonal antibody therapy. Some strategies to provide options for rural healthcare systems will be discussed here. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness occurs in two distinct phases, an early stage characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication followed by a late phase characterized by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and activation of the coagulation system resulting in a prothrombotic state. Antiviral therapy and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective if used during the early phase of the illness. Immunomodulating therapies, either alone or in combination with antiviral and antibody-based therapies, may be more effective when used in the later stage to combat the cytokine-mediated hyperinflammatory state that causes severe illness.[4] Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection and severe disease. However, as noted previously, high-risk individuals are those aged ≥60 years and with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection.

Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro. In addition, three antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies, due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition, and formatting flexibility, should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an unprecedented global crisis, and curtailing its spread requires an effective vaccine which elicits a diverse and robust immune response. We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It was shown that immunocompromised patients have significantly reduced immunologic responses to COVID-19 vaccines. The immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine/infection in patients with solid tumors is reduced. We evaluated the immunologic response to COVID-19 and/or the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine among cancer patients on active treatments and reviewed previous literature to identify subgroups that may require third vaccination.\\nAnti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 antibodies were measured in a cohort of 202 cancer patients on active treatment with chemotherapy (96), immunologic (52), biologic (46), and hormonal (12) treatments for early (n\\xa0= 66, 32.7%) or metastatic disease (n\\xa0= 136, 67.3%). Of those, 172 had received two vaccine doses, and 30 had COVID-19 infection (20/30 also received one dose of vaccine). Specific anti-S receptor-binding domain antibodies were further measured in patients with equivocal anti-S1/S2 results.\\nAmong cancer patients, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response rate was 89.1% (180/202) after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and 87.2% (150/172) in patients after vaccination without a history of COVID-19, compared with 100% positive serologic tests in a control group of 30 health care workers (P < 0.001). Chemotherapy treatment was independently associated with significantly reduced humoral response to infection or vaccination, with an 81.3% response rate, compared with 96.2% in patients on other treatments (P\\xa0= 0.001). In vaccinated patients on chemotherapy, the positive response rate was 77.5%. In a multiple regression model, a neutralizing antibody titer (>60 AU/ml) was more likely with immunotherapy (odds ratio 2.44) and less likely with chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.39).\\nOverall, both COVID-19 vaccine and natural infection are highly immunogenic among cancer patients. Our study, however, identifies those under chemotherapy as significantly less responsive, and with lower antibody levels. These findings justify close virological and serological surveillance along with consideration of these patients for booster (third dose) vaccine prioritization, as new highly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Monitoring the burden and spread of infection with the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, whether within small communities or in large geographical settings, is of paramount importance for public health purposes. Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection. As a result, our RBD-based ELISA protocols are well suited for seroepidemiology and other large-scale studies requiring parsimonious sample collection outside of healthcare settings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are emerging as safe and effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. However, variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 have evolved, with early studies showing that some mAbs may not sustain their efficacy in the face of escape mutants. Also, from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, concern has been raised about the potential for Fcγ receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. In this study, plaque reduction neutralization assays demonstrated that mAb 1741-LALA neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 strains B.1.351, D614 and D614G. MAbs S1D2-hIgG1 and S1D2-LALA mutant (STI-1499-LALA) did not neutralize B.1.351, but did neutralize SARS-CoV-2 strains D614 and D614G. LALA mutations did not result in substantial differences in neutralizing abilities between clones S1D2-hIgG1 vs STI-1499-LALA. S1D2-hIgG1, STI-1499-LALA, and convalescent plasma showed minimal ability to induce ADE in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Further, no differences in pharmacokinetic clearance of S1D2-hIgG1 vs STI-1499-LALA were observed in mice expressing human FcRn. These findings confirm that SARS-CoV-2 has already escaped some mAbs, and identify a mAb candidate that may neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. They also suggest that risk of ADE in macrophages may be low with SARS-CoV-2 D614, and LALA Fc change impacts neither viral neutralization nor Ab clearance.',\n",

This review summarizes current knowledge and new discoveries about human milk and mucosal immunity.\\nNew data suggest that certain microbes in maternal milk may seed and shape the infant gut microbiota, which play a key role in regulating gut barrier integrity and training the developing immune system. Human milk oligosaccharides, best known for their prebiotic functions, have now been shown to directly modulate gene expression in mast and goblet cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Epidemiologic data show a reduced risk of peanut sensitization among infants breastfed by peanut-consuming mothers, suggesting a role for milk-borne food antigens in tolerance development. Cross-fostering experiments in mice suggest the soluble Toll-like receptor 2, found in human milk, may be critical in this process. Finally, interest in human milk antibodies surged during the pandemic with the identification of neutralizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies in maternal milk following both natural infection and vaccination.\\nHuman milk provides critical immune protection and stimulation to breastfed infants.

Convalescent volunteers were also investigated to evaluate adaptive immunity induced by live virus. Although both vaccines induced antibody- and T cell-mediated immune responses, our analysis revealed significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the two types of challenges. The BBIBP-CorV vaccine elicited antireceptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG, as well as anti-spike protein (S) IgG and IgA antibodies in healthy individuals, the levels of which were much lower than after BNT162b2 vaccination but still higher than in the convalescent patients. The cumulative IFNγ-positive T cell response, however, was only twofold higher in participants injected with BNT162b2 compared to those who were primed and boosted with BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Moreover, the inactivated virus vaccine induced T cell response that targets not only the S but also the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, whereas the mRNA vaccine was able to elicit a much narrower response that targets the S protein epitopes only. Thus, the pattern of BBIBP-CorV-induced T cell response in virus-naive participants was similar to the cell-mediated anti-SARS-CoV-2 response observed in convalescent patients. Based on these data, we can conclude that the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine is immunologically effective. However, the duration of BBIBP-CorV-induced integrated, antibody, and T cell-mediated, immune responses needs further investigation.',\n",

Single-dose vaccination with NDV-FLS significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs but only mildly decreased lung inflammation. NDV-Δ19S-treated hamsters had a moderate decrease in SARS-CoV-2 titers in lungs and presented with severe microscopic lesions, suggesting that truncation of the spike protein was a less effective strategy.

Acquired mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affecting virus infectivity and/or immunogenicity have led to a number of novel strains with higher transmissibility compared to the original Wuhan strain. Mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been extensively studied in this context. However, mutations and deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) located adjacent to the RBD are less studied. Many of these are found within certain β sheet-linking loops, which are surprisingly long in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and other related β coronaviruses. Here, we perform a structural and epidemiological study of novel strains carrying mutations and deletions within these loops. We identify short and long-distance interactions that stabilize the NTD loops of the spike protein and form a critical epitope that is essential for the recognition by a wide variety of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent plasma. Among the different mutations/deletions found in these loops, Ala 67 and Asp 80 mutations as well as His 69/Val 70 and Tyr 144 deletions have been identified in different fast-spreading strains. Similarly, deletions in amino acids 241-243 and 246-252 have been found to affect the network of NTD loops in strains with high transmissibility. Our structural findings provide insight regarding the role of these mutations/deletions in altering the epitope structure and thus affecting the immunoreactivity of the NTD region of spike protein.',\n",

The molecular weight of mHla-RBD is up to 450 kDa, approximately 10 times higher than that of the RBD monomer. When formulated with alum adjuvant, mHla-RBD immunization significantly increased the immunogenicity of RBD, as indicated by increased titers of RBD-specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, Th2 cellular immune response, and pseudovirus neutralization activity, when compared to RBD monomer. Furthermore, we confirmed that RBD-specific antibodies predominantly target conformational epitopes, which was approximately 200 times that targeting linear epitopes. Finally, a pseudovirus neutralization assay revealed that neutralizing antibodies induced by mHla-RBD against different SARS-CoV-2 variants were comparable to those against the wild-type virus and showed broad-spectrum neutralizing activity toward different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results demonstrated that mHla-RBD is a promising candidate antigen for development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the mHla could serve as a universal carrier protein for antigen design.',\n",

Though vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed to fight COVID-19 in the past year, one major concern is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 VOCs such as B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1 (Brazil), and B.1.617.1 (India) now dominate the pandemic. Herein, we found that binding activity and neutralizing capacity of sera collected from convalescent patients in early 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, but not non-VOC variants, were severely blunted. Furthermore, we observed evasion of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from a VH3-30 mAb 32D4, which was proved to exhibit highly potential neutralization against wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2. Thus, these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be able to spread in convalescent patients and even harbor resistance to medical countermeasures.

       "  'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread to all parts of the world and can cause life-threatening pneumonia and other severe disease manifestations known as COVID-19. This health crisis has resulted in a significant effort to stop the spread of this new coronavirus. However, while propagating itself in the human population, the virus accumulates mutations and generates new variants with increased fitness and the ability to escape the human immune response. Here we describe a color-based barcoded spike flow cytometric assay (BSFA) that is particularly useful to evaluate and directly compare the humoral immune response directed against either wild type (WT) or mutant spike (S) proteins or the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This assay employs the human B lymphoma cell line Ramos, transfected for stable expression of WT or mutant S proteins or a chimeric RBD-CD8 fusion protein. We find that the alpha and beta mutants are more stably expressed than the WT S protein on the Ramos B cell surface and/or bind with higher affinity to the viral entry receptor ACE2. However, we find a reduce expression of the chimeric RBD-CD8 carrying the point mutation N501Y and E484K characteristic for the alpha and beta variant, respectively. The comparison of the humoral immune response of 12 vaccinated probands with 12 COVID-19 patients shows that after the boost, the S-specific IgG class immune response in the vaccinated group is similar to that of the patient group. However, in comparison to WT the specific IgG serum antibodies bind less well to the alpha variant and only poorly to the beta variant S protein. This is in line with the notion that the beta variant is an immune escape variant of SARS-CoV-2. The IgA class immune response was more variable than the IgG response and higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the vaccinated group. In summary, we think that our BSFA represents a useful tool to evaluate the humoral immunity against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to analyze new vaccination protocols against these variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus strains is posing new COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment challenges. To help efforts to meet these challenges we examined data acquired from proteomic analyses of human SARS-CoV-2-infected cell lines and samples from COVID-19 patients. Initially, 129 unique peptides were identified, which were rigorously evaluated for repeats, disorders, polymorphisms, antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, allergens, sequence similarity to human proteins, and contributions from other potential cross-reacting pathogenic species or the human saliva microbiome. We also screened SARS-CoV-2-infected NBHE and A549 cell lines for presence of antigenic peptides, and identified paratope peptides from crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-antibody complexes. We then selected four antigen peptides for docking with known viral unbound T-cell receptor (TCR), class I and II peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC), and identified paratope sequences. We also tested the paratope binding affinity of SARS-CoV T- and B-cell peptides that had been previously experimentally validated. The resultant antigenic peptides have high potential for generating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, and the paratope peptides can be directly used to develop a COVID-19 diagnostics assay.

This is important to predict the current and future status of the pandemic. With the recent emergence of new and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants, assays allowing for high throughput analysis of antibodies able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 become even more important. Here, we report the development and validation of a robust, high throughput method, which enables the assessment of antibodies inhibiting the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay uses recombinantly produced spike-f and ACE2 and is performed in a bead array format, which allows analysis of up to 384 samples in parallel per instrument over seven hours, demanding only one hour of manual handling. The method is compared to a microneutralization assay utilising live SARS-CoV-2 and is shown to deliver highly correlating data. Further, a comparison with a serological method that measures all antibodies recognizing the spike protein shows that this type of assessment provides important insights into the neutralizing efficiency of the antibodies, especially for individuals with low antibody levels. This method can be an important and valuable tool for large-scale assessment of antibody-based neutralization, including neutralization of new spike variants that might emerge.',\n",

We tested the sensitivity and performance of a simple and rapid SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T cell test based on the stimulation of whole blood with peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, followed by cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2) measurement in different cohorts including BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals (n = 112), convalescent asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients (n = 130), and SARS-CoV-1-convalescent individuals (n = 12). The sensitivity of this rapid test is comparable to that of traditional methods of T cell analysis (ELISPOT, activation-induced marker). Using this test, we observed a similar mean magnitude of T cell responses between the vaccinees and SARS-CoV-2 convalescents 3 months after vaccination or virus priming. However, a wide heterogeneity of the magnitude of spike-specific T cell responses characterized the individual responses, irrespective of the time of analysis. The magnitude of these spike-specific T cell responses cannot be predicted from the neutralizing antibody levels. Hence, both humoral and cellular spike-specific immunity should be tested after vaccination to define the correlates of protection necessary to evaluate current vaccine strategies.',\n",

The overall ensemble of ∼120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody-target interaction, is easily recognizable in EM images due to its unique shape, and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23-kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2-Å overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22-kDa receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6-Å resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody.

       "  'abstract': 'Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, antigenicity concerns continue to linger with emerging mutants. As recent variants have shown decreased reactivity to previously determined monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or sera, monitoring the antigenicity change of circulating mutants is urgently needed for vaccine effectiveness. Currently, antigenic comparison is mainly carried out by immuno-binding assays. Yet, an online predicting system is highly desirable to complement the targeted experimental tests from the perspective of time and cost. Here, we provided a platform of SAS (Spike protein Antigenicity for SARS-CoV-2), enabling predicting the resistant effect of emerging variants and the dynamic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among circulating strains. When being compared to experimental results, SAS prediction obtained the consistency of 100% on 8 mAb-binding tests with detailed epitope covering mutational sites, and 80.3% on 223 anti-serum tests. Moreover, on the latest South Africa escaping strain (B.1.351), SAS predicted a significant resistance to reference strain at multiple mutated epitopes, agreeing well with the vaccine evaluation results. SAS enables auto-updating from GISAID, and the current version collects 867K GISAID strains, 15.4K unique spike (S) variants, and 28 validated and predicted epitope regions that include 339 antigenic sites. Together with the targeted immune-binding experiments, SAS may be helpful to reduce the experimental searching space, indicate the emergence and expansion of antigenic variants, and suggest the dynamic coverage of representative mAbs/vaccines among the latest circulating strains.

       "  'abstract': 'The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants has quickly spanned doubts and the fear about their ability escape vaccine protection. Some of these variants initially identified in caged were also found in humans. The claim that these variants exhibited lower susceptibility to antibody neutralization led to the slaughter of 17 million minks in Denmark. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence tests led to the discovery of infected farmed minks worldwide. In this study, we revisit the issue of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in minks as a model of sarbecovirus interspecies evolution by: (1) comparing human and mink angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) receptors; (2) comparing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from humans and minks; (3) analyzing the impact of mutations on the 3D structure of the spike protein; and (4) predicting linear epitope targets for immune response. Mink-selected SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the Y453F/D614G mutations display an increased affinity for human ACE2 and can escape neutralization by one monoclonal antibody. However, they are unlikely to lose most of the major epitopes predicted to be targets for neutralizing antibodies.

       "  'abstract': 'Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) involves the attachment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike proteins to the ACE2 receptors on the peripheral membrane of host cells. Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies that search for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD. However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and is therefore a hotspot for drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and residues distant to it in the spike protein. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular recognition events and prediction of the highest-effect key mutations in distant, allosteric sites, with implications for therapeutics. Also, these sites can appear in emerging mutants with possibly higher transmissibility and virulence, and preidentifying them can give clues for designing pan-coronavirus vaccines against future outbreaks. Our model, based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Residues involved in the most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab initio from our model. Conversely, broad-spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal antibodies can target these key distant-but-conserved regions of the spike protein.',\n",

Linear mixed models were used to assess the dynamics of antibody levels and to determine predictors of antibody levels at 6 months.\\nThe study included 4868 participants, with 3808 being included in the linear mixed-model analyses. The level of IgG antibodies decreased at a consistent rate, whereas the neutralizing antibody level decreased rapidly for the first 3 months with a relatively slow decrease thereafter. Although IgG antibody levels were highly correlated with neutralizing antibody titers (Spearman's rank correlation between 0.68 and 0.75), the regression relationship between the IgG and neutralizing antibody levels depended on the time since receipt of the second vaccine dose. Six months after receipt of the second dose, neutralizing antibody titers were substantially lower among men than among women (ratio of means, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.75), lower among persons 65 years of age or older than among those 18 to less than 45 years of age (ratio of means, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.70), and lower among participants with immunosuppression than among those without immunosuppression (ratio of means, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.46).\\nSix months after receipt of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, humoral response was substantially decreased, especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.\",\n",

Three major outbreaks followed, resulting in over 800,000 cases and over 6,000 deaths by April 2021. Our aim was characterization of a serological snapshot of Israeli patients and healthy adults in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sera from 55 symptomatic COVID-19 patients and 146 healthy subjects (early-pandemic, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR [qRT-PCR]-negative), collected in Israel between March and April 2020, were screened for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, using a 6-plex antigen microarray presenting the whole inactivated virus and five viral antigens: a stabilized version of the spike ectodomain (S2P), spike subunit 1 (S1), receptor-binding-domain (RBD), N-terminal-domain (NTD), and nucleocapsid (NC). COVID-19 patients, 4 to 40\\u2009days post symptom onset, presented specific IgG to all of the viral antigens (6/6) in 54 of the 55 samples (98% sensitivity). Specific IgM and IgA antibodies for all six antigens were detected in only 10% (5/55) and 4% (2/55) of the patients, respectively, suggesting that specific IgG is a superior serological marker for COVID-19. None of the qRT-PCR-negative sera reacted with all six viral antigens (100% specificity), and 48% (70/146) were negative throughout the panel. Our findings confirm a low seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Israeli adult population prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We further suggest that the presence of low-level cross-reacting antibodies in naive individuals calls for a combined, multiantigen analysis for accurate discrimination between naive and exposed individuals.

In a subset of samples, we assessed antibodies to a panel of Plasmodium falciparum antigens by suspension bead array and functional antiviral activity by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain developed in the United States using Malian positive and negative control samples. To optimize test performance, we compared single- and 2-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs.\\nBackground reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was common in prepandemic Malian samples. The SARS-CoV-2 reactivity varied between communities, increased with age, and correlated negligibly/weakly with other betacoronavirus and P falciparum antibodies. No prepandemic samples demonstrated functional activity. Regardless of the cutoffs applied, test specificity improved using a 2-antigen approach. Test performance was optimal using a 2-antigen assay with population-specific cutoffs (sensitivity, 73.9% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 51.6-89.8]; specificity, 99.4% [95% CI, 97.7-99.9]).\\nWe have addressed the problem of SARS-CoV-2 seroassay performance in Africa by using a 2-antigen assay with cutoffs defined by performance in the target population.',\n",

Using SARS-CoV-1 and bat RaTG13-CoV as comparisons, we identified two molecular switches that regulate the conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: (i) a furin motif loop turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from a closed conformation to a mixture of open and closed conformations, and (ii) a K417V mutation turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from mixed conformations to an open conformation. We showed that the open conformation favors viral potency by exposing the RBD for receptor binding and viral entry, while the closed conformation supports viral immune evasion by hiding the RBD from neutralizing antibodies. Hence SARS-CoV-2 spike has evolved to reach a balance between potency and immune evasiveness, which contributes to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2.The dynamics between viral potency and invasiveness is likely to further evolve, providing insights into future evolution of SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Herein, SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide immunoprofiling of children with mild/moderate or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) versus multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children versus hospitalized control patients revealed differential cytokine responses, IgM/IgG/IgA epitope diversity, antibody binding and avidity. Apart from spike and nucleocapsid, IgG/IgA recognized epitopes in nonstructural protein (NSP) 2, NSP3, NSP12-NSP14 and open reading frame (ORF) 3a-ORF9. Peptides representing epitopes in NSP12, ORF3a and ORF8 demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnosis. Antibody-binding kinetics with 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed antibody parameters that distinguish children with mild/moderate versus severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Antibody avidity to prefusion spike correlated with decreased illness severity and served as a clinical disease indicator. The fusion peptide and heptad repeat 2 region induced SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Thus, we identified SARS-CoV-2 antibody signatures in children associated with disease severity and delineate promising serodiagnostic and virus neutralization targets.

Much of this response has focused, appropriately, on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, and in particular the binding of the spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and subsequent membrane fusion. This Review provides the structural and cellular foundations for understanding the multistep SARS-CoV-2 entry process, including S protein synthesis, S protein structure, conformational transitions necessary for association of the S protein with ACE2, engagement of the receptor-binding domain of the S protein with ACE2, proteolytic activation of the S protein, endocytosis and membrane fusion. We define the roles of furin-like proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in these processes, and delineate the features of ACE2 orthologues in reservoir animal species and S protein adaptations that facilitate efficient human transmission. We also examine the utility of vaccines, antibodies and other potential therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms.

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit a humoral immune response capable of neutralising the virus. However, multiple variants have emerged with mutations in the spike protein amongst others, the key target of neutralising antibodies. We evaluated the neutralising efficacy of 89 serum samples from patients, infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of 2020, against two virus variants isolated from acutely infected patients and harbouring spike protein mutations. One isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.351 (MUC-IMB-B.1.351) whilst the other (MUC-484) was isolated from an immunocompromised patient, sharing some but not all mutations with B.1.351 and representing a transitional variant. Both variants showed a significant reduction in neutralisation sensitivity compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with MUC-IMB-B.1.351 being almost completely resistant to neutralisation. The observed reduction in neutralising activity of wild-type-specific antibodies against both variants suggests that individual mutations in the spike protein are sufficient to confer a potent escape from the humoral immune response. In addition, the effect of escape mutations seems to accumulate, so that more heavily mutated variants show a greater loss of sensitivity to neutralisation up to complete insensitivity as observed for MUC-IMB-B.1.351. From a clinical point of view, this might affect the efficacy of (monoclonal) antibody treatment of patients with prolonged infections as well as patients infected with variants other than the donor. At the same, this could also negatively influence the efficacy of current vaccines (as they are based on wild-type spike protein) emphasising the need to thoroughly surveil the emergence and distribution of variants and adapt vaccines and therapeutics accordingly.',\n",

Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150, and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent-phase sera were reduced by 4- to 16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E, or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs did not enhance their neutralization potential.

Although all immunoassays demonstrated similar performances, VIDAS SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Euroimmun QuantiVac IgG (area under the curve 0.96 and 0.95 respectively) showed the better ability to detect Nabs. Except for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assays, the commercial serologic tests evaluated here showed a significant decrease of antibody titers in the 6-month follow-up samples. Depending on the immunoassay, 21% to 33% of the participants became seronegative, and 16.9% had a loss of neutralizing antibodies. Microblot-Array assay results showed cross-reactivity with HCoVNL63 in only one sample, and this sample showed SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity. In conclusion, our results support the use of VIDAS SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA IgG and Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG assays to monitor neutralizing antibody response following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern possess several mutations within the S protein that enhance receptor interaction, fusogenicity and antibody binding. In this review, we discuss the molecular determinants of S mediated fusion and the antiviral innate immunity components that counteract syncytia formation. Several interferon-stimulated genes, including IFITMs and LY6E act as barriers to S protein-mediated fusion by altering the composition or biophysical properties of the target membrane.

Subunit vaccines are considered among the safest, but proteins used in these typically lack strong immunogenicity, leading to poor immune responses. Here, a biomaterial COVID-19 vaccine based on a mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) platform is described. MSRs loaded with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), and SARS-CoV-2 viral protein antigens slowly release their cargo and form subcutaneous scaffolds that locally recruit and activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the generation of adaptive immunity. MSR-based vaccines generate robust and durable cellular and humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the poorly immunogenic receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Persistent antibodies over the course of 8 months are found in all vaccine configurations tested and robust in vitro viral neutralization is observed both in a prime-boost and a single-dose regimen. These vaccines can be fully formulated ahead of time or stored lyophilized and reconstituted with an antigen mixture moments before injection, which can facilitate its rapid deployment against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or new pathogens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research articles for the current study were searched over PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science online databases. The keywords used were: ((\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\") AND (\"mutation\" OR \"variant\") AND (\"death\" OR \"hospitalization\" OR \"infection\" OR \"transmission\") AND (\"antibody\" OR \"neutralize\" OR \"vaccine\")). A total of 333 research articles were retrieved through online-database search. These articles were further scrutinized for their relevancy. Additionally, searches were performed to find the latest relevant information over Google search engine and relevant news browsers. Finally, around 35 germane articles were considered for scripting the current report. RESULTS: The mutations have changed amino acids at key positions in spike protein viz. S477N, E484K, Q677H, E484Q, L452R, K417T, K417N and N501Y. These mutations are relevant for different characteristics and are present in newly evolved strains of SARS-CoV-2 like E484K in B.1.526, B.1.525, P.2, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351. Mutations have increased the immune escape potential leading to 3.5-6.5-folds decrease in neutralization of antibodies (Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). The variant, B.1.617 circulating in India and many other countries (double variant) having E484Q and L452R mutations, has raised the infection rate and decreased the neutralization capacity of the vaccine-induced antibodies. Deadly K417N+E484K+N501Y triplet mutations found in B.1.351 and P.1 have increased the transmission ability of these strains by 50% leading to greater COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admissions and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The new SARS-CoV-2 variants have compromised the neutralization potential of the currently used vaccines, but still, they have considerable efficacy to reduce infection and mortality.\\nhttps://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Graphical_Abstract.jpg.',\n",

The trial was conducted at 9 sites in Australia and 8 sites in the United States. Participants in 2 age groups (aged 18 to 59 and 60 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 1 or 2 intramuscular doses of 5-μg or 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7-day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild-type virus neutralizing antibody response. After enrollment, 1,288 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vaccine groups or placebo, with 1,283 participants administered at least 1 study treatment. Of these, 45% were older participants 60 to 84 years. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose.

       "  'abstract': 'In the absence of effective antiviral chemotherapy and still in the context of emerging vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 infections, passive immunotherapy remains a key treatment and possible prevention strategy. What might initially be conceived as a simplified donor-recipient process, the intricacies of donor plasma, IV immunoglobulins, and monoclonal antibody modality applications are becoming more apparent. Key targets of such treatment have largely focused on virus neutralization and the specific viral components of the attachment Spike protein and its constituents (e.g., receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain). The cumulative laboratory and clinical experience suggests that beneficial protective and treatment outcomes are possible. Both a dose- and a time-dependency emerge. Lesser understood are the concepts of bioavailability and distribution. Apart from direct antigen binding from protective immunoglobulins, antibody effector functions have potential roles in outcome. In attempting to mimic the natural but variable response to infection or vaccination, a strong functional polyclonal approach attracts the potential benefits of attacking antigen diversity, high antibody avidity, antibody persistence, and protection against escape viral mutation. The availability and ease of administration for any passive immunotherapy product must be considered in the current climate of need. There is never a perfect product, but yet there is considerable room for improving patient outcomes. Given the variability of human genetics, immunity, and disease, and given the nuances of the virus and its potential for change, passive immunotherapy can be developed that will be effective for some but not all patients. An understanding of such patient variability and limitations is just as important as the understanding of the direct interactions between immunotherapy and virus.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To assess in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, treated with different immunosuppressive therapies, the induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response after vaccination in terms of anti-region-binding-domain (RBD)-antibody- and T-cell-specific responses against spike, and the vaccine safety in terms of clinical impact on disease activity.\\nHealth care workers (HCWs) and RA patients, having completed the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccination in the last 2 weeks, were enrolled. Serological response was evaluated by quantifying anti-RBD antibodies, while the cell-mediated response was evaluated by a whole-blood test quantifying the interferon (IFN)-γ-response to spike peptides. FACS analysis was performed to identify the cells responding to spike stimulation. RA disease activity was evaluated by clinical examination through the DAS28crp, and local and/or systemic clinical adverse events were registered. In RA patients, the ongoing therapeutic regimen was modified during the vaccination period according to the American College of Rheumatology indications.\\nWe prospectively enrolled 167 HCWs and 35 RA patients. Anti-RBD-antibodies were detected in almost all patients (34/35, 97%), although the titer was significantly reduced in patients under CTLA-4-inhibitors (median: 465 BAU/mL, IQR: 103-1189, p<0.001) or IL-6-inhibitors (median: 492 BAU/mL, IQR: 161-1007, p<0.001) compared to HCWs (median: 2351 BAU/mL, IQR: 1389-3748). T-cell-specific response scored positive in most of RA patients [24/35, (69%)] with significantly lower IFN-γ levels in patients under biological therapy such as IL-6-inhibitors (median: 33.2 pg/mL, IQR: 6.1-73.9, p<0.001), CTLA-4-inhibitors (median: 10.9 pg/mL, IQR: 3.7-36.7, p<0.001), and TNF-α-inhibitors (median: 89.6 pg/mL, IQR: 17.8-224, p=0.002) compared to HCWs (median: 343 pg/mL, IQR: 188-756). A significant correlation between the anti-RBD-antibody titer and spike-IFN-γ-specific T-cell response was found in RA patients (rho=0.432, p=0.009). IFN-γ T-cell response was mediated by CD4\\nThis study showed for the first time that antibody-specific and whole-blood spike-specific T-cell responses induced by the COVID-19 mRNA-vaccine were present in the majority of RA patients, who underwent a strategy of temporary suspension of immunosuppressive treatment during vaccine administration. However, the magnitude of specific responses was dependent on the immunosuppressive therapy administered. In RA patients, BNT162b2 vaccine was safe and disease activity remained stable.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have shown high efficacy, but immunocompromised participants were excluded from controlled clinical trials. In this study, we compared immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine in patients with solid tumors (n\\u2009=\\u200953) who were on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy to a control cohort of participants without cancer (n\\u2009=\\u200950). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67% of patients with cancer after the first immunization, followed by a threefold increase in median titers after the second dose. Similar patterns were observed for spike protein-specific serum antibodies and T cells, but the magnitude of each of these responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. In most patients with cancer, we detected spike receptor-binding domain and other S1-specific memory B cell subsets as potential predictors of anamnestic responses to additional immunizations. We therefore initiated a phase 1 trial for 20 cancer cohort participants of a third vaccine dose of BNT162b2 ( NCT04936997 ); primary outcomes were immune responses, with a secondary outcome of safety. At 1 week after a third immunization, 16 participants demonstrated a median threefold increase in neutralizing antibody responses, but no improvement was observed in T cell responses. Adverse events were mild. These results suggest that a third dose of BNT162b2 is safe, improves humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and could be immunologically beneficial for patients with cancer on active chemotherapy.',\n",

Although patients with vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes, the exact mechanism of the development of thrombosis is still unknown. Here we reported serum studies as well as proteomics and genomics analyses demonstrating a massive complement activation potentially linked to the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies in a patient with severe VITT. At admission, complement activity of the classical and lectin pathways were absent (0% for both) with normal levels of the alternative pathway (73%) in association with elevated levels of the complement activation marker sC5b-9 (630\\xa0ng/mL [n.v. 139-462\\xa0ng/mL]) and anti-PF4 IgG (1.918 OD [n.v. 0.136-0.300 OD]). The immunoblotting analysis of C2 showed the complete disappearance of its normal band at 110\\xa0kDa. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment allowed to recover complement activity of the classical pathway (91%) and lectin pathway (115%), to reduce levels of sC5b-9 (135\\xa0ng/mL) and anti-PF4 IgG (0.681 OD) and to normalize the C2 pattern at immunoblotting. Proteomics and genomics analyses in addition to serum studies showed that the absence of complement activity during VITT was not linked to alterations of the C2 gene but rather to a strong complement activation leading to C2 consumption. Our data in a single patient suggest monitoring complement parameters in other VITT patients considering also the possibility to target complement activation with specific drugs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'N-glycosylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. However, the role of SARS-CoV-2 RBD N-glycosylation in viral entry remains elusive. In this study, we expressed and purified N331 and N343 N-glycosite mutants of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that de-glycosylation at N331 and N343 drastically reduces the RBD binding to ACE2. More importantly, based on qualitative and quantitative virology research methods, we show that the mutation of RBD N-glycosites interfered with SARS-CoV-2 internalization rather than attachment potentially by decreasing RBD binding to the receptors. Also, the double N-glycosites mutant (N331\\xa0+\\xa0N343) showed significantly increased sensitivity against the designated RBD neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these results suggest that N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is not only critical for viral internalization into respiratory epithelial cells but also shields the virus from neutralization. It may provide new insights into the biological process of early-stage SARS-CoV-2 infection with potential therapeutic implications.',\n",

Therefore, the need for ongoing discovery efforts to identify broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance. Here, we report a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies isolated using the linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq) technology from an individual who recovered from COVID-19. Of these antibodies, 54042-4 shows potent neutralization against authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses, including variants of concern (VOCs). A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 54042-4 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals an epitope composed of residues that are highly conserved in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Further, 54042-4 possesses uncommon genetic and structural characteristics that distinguish it from other potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Together, these findings provide motivation for the development of 54042-4 as a lead candidate to counteract current and future SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.',\n",

In particular, the emergence of several variants with greater infectivity and resistance to current vaccines has motivated the development of a vaccine that elicits a broadly neutralizing immune response against all variants. In this study, we used a nanoparticle-based vaccine platform for the multivalent display of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Multiple copies of RBD were conjugated to the SpyCatcher-mi3 protein nanoparticle to produce a highly immunogenic nanoparticle-based vaccine. RBD-SpyCatcher-mi3 vaccines elicited broadly cross-reactive antibodies that recognized the spike proteins of not just an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but also three SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern as well as SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, immunization elicited high neutralizing antibody titers against an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2 as well as four variants of concern, including the delta variant. These results reveal the potential of RBD-SpyCatcher-mi3 as a broadly protective vaccination strategy.',\n",

The results of these tests were compared against the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Roche Elecsys had the highest sensitivity, and the Genscript cPass had the highest specificity. Diasorin-TrimericS IgG had the best overall performance with the highest agreement with the PRNT results. Parallel testing of Genscript cPass with Diasorin-TrimericS IgG and Diasorin-S1/S2 IgG had the optimum performance. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, lowering the cutoff from 30% to 20% in the Genscript cPass significantly increased the sensitivity and the overall agreement with the PRNT results. Commercially available serological assays are good alternatives to the standard PRNT. However, further studies on larger sample numbers are required for optimization of the assay cutoff values and for evaluation of cost effectiveness. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Measuring the antibody response to 2019 SARS CoV2 is critical for diagnostic purposes, for monitoring the prevalence of infection, and for gauging the efficacy of the worldwide vaccination effort for COVID-19. In this study, a microchip-based grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonic (GC-FP) assay was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from COVID-19 infection and vaccination. In addition, we measured the relative antibody binding toward antigens from the CoV2 virus variants strains B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta). Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals, while those against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence and also resolved acute (within hours) increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant, but not B.1.1.7, was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens. These results were corroborated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collectively, the findings suggest that GC-FP is a viable, rapid, and accurate method for measuring both overall antibody levels to SARS CoV2 and relative antibody binding to viral variants during infection or vaccination.

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells upon binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors. Several nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, but how their binding antagonizes S-ACE2 interactions is not well understood. Here, we identified interactions between the RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. H11-H4 and H11-D4 can bind to RBD without overlapping with ACE2. H11-H4, and to a lesser extent H11-D4, binding dislocates ACE2 from its binding site due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 overlaps with ACE2 on RBD and has a similar binding strength to ACE2. Mutations in the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 had a minor effect in RBD binding strengths of ACE2 and nanobodies, but reduced the ability of H11-H4 and H11-D4 to dislocate ACE2 from RBD. In comparison, the Beta variant weakened the RBD binding strengths of H11-H4 and H11-D4, which were less effective to dislocate ACE2 binding. Unexpectedly, mutations in Beta strengthened Ty1 binding to RBD, suggesting that this nanobody may be more effective to neutralize the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

The SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG (S-IgG) and nucleoprotein IgG (N-IgG) concentrations and the proportion of subjects with neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assessed. Moreover, the NAb titers among a smaller subset of participants (n = 78) against a WT virus (B) and variants of concern (VOCs): Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) were determined. We found that NAb against the WT virus persisted in 89% and S-IgG in 97% of subjects for at least 13 months after infection. Only 36% had N-IgG by 13 months. The mean S-IgG concentrations declined from 8 to 13 months by less than one third; N-IgG concentrations declined by two-thirds. Subjects with severe infection had markedly higher IgG and NAb levels and are expected to remain seropositive for longer. Significantly lower NAb titers against the variants compared to the WT virus, especially after a mild disease, suggests reduced protection against VOCs.',\n",

Potential viral entry sites were investigated by histochemistry using tagged recombinant viral S protein on 52 ocular tissue samples including specimens of the cornea, conjunctiva, lid margin, lacrimal gland tissue, retina, choroid, and RPE. In addition, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 immunohistochemistry were performed on the same ocular tissue, each with distinct antibodies binding to different epitopes. Lung tissue samples were used as positive controls. Finally, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to determine the expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary factors in the tissues mentioned above. S protein histochemistry revealed a positive staining in lung tissue but absent staining in the cornea, the conjunctiva, eye lid samples, the lacrimal glands, the retina and the optic nerve which was supported by hardly any immunoreactivity for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and scarce ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA expression. Negligible staining with antibodies targeting ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was seen in the main and accessory lacrimal glands. In contrast, ocular staining (S protein, ACE2, TMPRSS2) was distinctly present in pigmented cells of the RPE and choroid, as well as in the ciliary body and the iris stroma. S protein histochemistry revealed hardly any SARS-CoV-2 entry sites in all ocular tissues examined. Similarly, no significant ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression was found in extra- and intraocular tissue.

Crystal structures show that both antibodies bind a cryptic site different from that recognized by existing antibodies and highly conserved across Sarbecovirus isolates. Binding of these two antibodies to the RBD clashes with the adjacent N-terminal domain and disrupts the viral spike.

The potential of a plant-based system for rapid production at a commercial scale and for a quick response to an infectious disease outbreak has been demonstrated by the marketing of carrot-cell-produced taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) for Gaucher disease and tobacco-produced monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp) for the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Currently, two plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates, coronavirus virus-like particle (CoVLP) and Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP)-201, are in clinical trials, and many more are in the preclinical stage. Interim phase 2 clinical trial results have revealed the high safety and efficacy of the CoVLP vaccine, with 10 times more neutralizing antibody responses compared to those present in a convalescent patient's plasma. The clinical trial of the CoVLP vaccine could be concluded by the end of 2021, and the vaccine could be available for public immunization thereafter. This review encapsulates the efforts made in plant-based COVID-19 vaccine development, the strategies and technologies implemented, and the progress accomplished in clinical trials and preclinical studies so far.\",\n",

Herein, we analyzed differences in the antibody response elicited by inoculation of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through a peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that utilizes synthetic peptides derived from the spike protein in the immuno-adsorbent phase. Immunoreactivity against synthetic peptides was measured at different time points from vaccination and was also correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate that all vaccinated subjects except one show reactive antibodies to at least one peptide at both 30 and 60 days after injection of the first dose. Only one of the 19 analyzed subjects showed no antibody response toward any of the selected peptides, consistently with a lower neutralizing capacity. More importantly, our data showed that the antibody response elicited by inoculation of the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine appears to be qualitatively individual, both in the type of recognized peptides and in the temporal persistence of the antibody response. Together with previous published data, our findings suggest that for effective pandemic control, it is important to constantly monitor the antibody protection in the population, and the assay described here could be a valid tool for this purpose.',\n",

From its suspected origins in Wuhan, China, it spread to all corners of the world in a matter of months. The absence of high-performance, rapid diagnostic methods that could identify asymptomatic carriers contributed to its worldwide transmission. Serological tests offer numerous benefits compared to other assay platforms to screen large populations. First-generation assays contain targets that represent proteins from SARS-CoV-2. While they could be quickly produced, each actually has a mixture of specific and non-specific epitopes that vary in their reactivity for antibodies. To generate the next generation of the assay, epitopes were identified in three SARS-Cov-2 proteins (S, N, and Orf3a) by SPOT synthesis analysis. After their similarity to other pathogen sequences was analyzed, 11 epitopes outside of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that showed high reactivity and uniqueness to the virus. These were incorporated into a ß-barrel protein core to create a highly chimeric protein. Another de novo protein was designed that contained only epitopes in the RBD. In-house ELISAs suggest that both multiepitope proteins can serve as targets for high-performance diagnostic tests. Our approach to bioengineer chimeric proteins is highly amenable to other pathogens and immunological uses.',\n",

The subunit vaccines are the safest and most widely used vaccine platform and highly effective against a multitude of infectious diseases. An adjuvant is essential for subunit vaccines to enhance the magnitude and durability of immune responses. In this study, we determined whether a combination of toll-like receptor (TLR)1/2 and TLR3 agonists (L-pampo) can be a potent adjuvant for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccine. We measured a neutralizing antibody (nAb) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-blocking antibody against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). We also detected interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by using ELISPOT and ELISA assays. By employing a ferret model, we detected nAbs and IFN-γ producing cells and measured viral load in nasal wash after the challenge of SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antigens with L-pampo stimulated robust humoral and cellular immune responses. The efficacy of L-pampo was higher than the other adjuvants. Furthermore, in the ferret model, SARS-CoV-2 antigens with L-pampo elicited nAb response and antigen-specific cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2, resulting in substantially decreased viral load in their nasal wash. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antigens formulated with TLR agonists, L-pampo, can be a potent subunit vaccine to promote sufficient protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

To evaluate the kinetics, we followed 31 CP recipients longitudinally enrolled at a median of 3 days post symptom onset for changes in binding and neutralizing antibody titers and viral loads. Antibodies against the complete trimeric Spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD), as well as against the complete Nucleocapsid protein and the RNA binding domain (N-RBD) were determined at baseline and weekly following CP infusion. Neutralizing antibody (pseudotype NAb) titers were determined at the same time points. Viral loads were determined semi-quantitatively by SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Patients with low humoral responses at entry showed a robust increase of antibodies to all SARS-CoV-2 proteins and Nab, reaching peak levels within 2 weeks. The rapid increase in binding and neutralizing antibodies was paralleled by a concomitant clearance of the virus within the same timeframe. Patients with high humoral responses at entry demonstrated low or no further increases; however, virus clearance followed the same trajectory as in patients with low antibody response at baseline. Together, the sequential immunological and virological analysis of this well-defined cohort of patients early in infection shows the presence of high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies and potent clearance of the virus.',\n",

The aim of this study is to assess if any difference in antibody concentration between subjects exposed and not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 prior to BNT162b2 was present after the first dose and after the second dose of vaccine. Data were retrospectively collected from the clinical documentation of 337 healthcare workers who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing before and after BNT162b2. Total anti RBD (receptor-binding domain) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2's spike protein were measured before and 21 days after the first dose, and 12 days after the second dose of BNT162b2. Twenty-one days after the first dose, there was a statistically significant difference in antibody concentration between the two groups, which was also maintained twelve days after the second dose. In conclusion, antibody response after receiving BNT162b2 is greater in subjects who have been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 than in subjects who have not been previously exposed to the virus, both after 21 days after the first dose and after 12 days from the second dose.

Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations pose a threat due to their role in host cell entry via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor that might strengthen SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, or resistance against neutralizing antibodies. To understand the molecular structural link between RBD mutations and infectivity, the top five mutant RBDs (i.e., N501Y, E484K L452R, S477N, and N439K) were selected based on their recorded case numbers. These mutants along with wild-type (WT) RBD were studied through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns. The principal component analysis and the free energy landscape were used too. Interestingly, N501Y, N439K, and E484K mutations were observed to increase the rigidity in some RBD regions while increasing the flexibility of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region, suggesting a compensation of the entropy penalty. However, S477N and L452R RBDs were observed to increase the flexibility of the RBM region while maintaining similar flexibility in other RBD regions in comparison to WT RBD. Therefore, both mutations (especially S477N) might destabilize the RBD structure, as loose conformation compactness was observed. The destabilizing effect of S477N RBD was consistent with previous work on S477N mutation. Finally, the free energy landscape results showed that mutations changed WT RBD conformation while local minima were maintained for all mutant RBDs. In conclusion, RBD mutations definitely impact the WT RBD structure and conformation as well as increase the binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolving in diverse human populations. Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 1,036,030 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 30,806 NGS datasets from GISAID and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 2.5% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.6% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 5,472 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only 21 and 14 recurrent variants were found in at least 1% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 2.6% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition. These findings demonstrate the continuous importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak since December 2019, antigenic tests are widely used, for diagnosis purposes, to detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in nasopharyngeal fluid through its interactions with specific antibodies. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is subject to rapid mutations yielding more and more variants that might lose their affinity toward the currently used antibodies. The virus entry into the host cell involves interactions between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain. Consequently, ACE2 could be a target with limited mutation escaping possibilities. However, as the enzyme has not evolved to recognize the virus, its affinity with the spike protein receptor-binding domain is lower than that with specific antibodies. The present molecular dynamics simulations study suggests that the adsorption of the ACE2 on specific silane monolayers could increase its affinity toward the spike protein receptor-binding domain. Indeed, silane monolayers, combining silane molecules with short alkyl chains and positively charged head groups and silane molecules without charged head groups, could adsorb the ACE2 while maintaining its bioactivity (orientation compatible with the spike protein trapping, low conformational changes) and increasing its interactions with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions) to lead to an increase by 20% both in the binding free energy and in the enzyme /receptor-binding domain rupture force. This work could help develop biosensing tools efficient toward any variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is an urgent need for new generation anti-SARS-Cov-2 vaccines in order to increase the efficacy of immunization and its broadness of protection against viral variants that are continuously arising and spreading. The effect of variants on protective immunity afforded by vaccination has been mostly analyzed with regard to B cell responses. This analysis revealed variable levels of cross-neutralization capacity for presently available SARS-Cov-2 vaccines. Despite the dampened immune responses documented for some SARS-Cov-2 mutations, available vaccines appear to maintain an overall satisfactory protective activity against most variants of concern (VoC). This may be attributed, at least in part, to cell-mediated immunity. Indeed, the widely multi-specific nature of CD8 T cell responses should allow to avoid VoC-mediated viral escape, because mutational inactivation of a given CD8 T cell epitope is expected to be compensated by the persistent responses directed against unchanged co-existing CD8 epitopes. This is particularly relevant because some immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes are located within highly conserved SARS-Cov-2 regions that cannot mutate without impairing SARS-Cov-2 functionality. Importantly, some of these conserved epitopes are degenerate, meaning that they are able to associate with different HLA class I molecules and to be simultaneously presented to CD8 T cell populations of different HLA restriction. Based on these concepts, vaccination strategies aimed at potentiating the stimulatory effect on SARS-Cov-2-specific CD8 T cells should greatly enhance the efficacy of immunization against SARS-Cov-2 variants. Our review recollects, discusses and puts into a translational perspective all available experimental data\\xa0supporting these \"hot\" concepts, with special emphasis on the structural constraints that limit SARS-CoV-2 S-protein evolution and on potentially invariant and degenerate CD8\\xa0epitopes that lend themselves as excellent candidates for the rational development of next-generation, CD8 T-cell response-reinforced, COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

An in-depth investigation on COVID-19 pathogenesis is urgently needed to develop a strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we identified CD147 as a universal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Meanwhile, Meplazeumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, could block cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants-alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with inhibition rates of 68.7, 75.7, 52.1, 52.1, and 62.3% at 60\\u2009μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta. When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a \"spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis\": Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway. Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm. Importantly, Meplazumab could effectively inhibit viral entry and inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Therefore, our findings provided a new perspective for severe COVID-19-related pathogenesis.

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 200 million infections and over 4 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by many variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to tighter binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The tighter binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies/nanobodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies/nanobodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies/nanobodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody/nanobody drug design.',\n",

Here, we report an alternative strategy where reporter genes were placed upstream of the highly expressed viral nucleocapsid (N) gene followed by a porcine tescherovirus (PTV-1) 2A proteolytic cleavage site. The higher levels of reporter expression using this strategy resulted in efficient visualization of rSARS-CoV-2 in infected cultured cells and excised lungs or whole organism of infected K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice. Importantly, real-time viral infection was readily tracked using a noninvasive in vivo imaging system and allowed us to rapidly identify antibodies which are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Notably, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, in which a viral gene was not deleted, not only retained wild-type (WT) virus-like pathogenicity in vivo but also exhibited high stability in vitro and in vivo, supporting their use to investigate viral infection, dissemination, pathogenesis, and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are similar epitopes on viruses that are recognized or neutralized by same antibodies. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic profile.',\n",

In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2, denoted VIU-1005. The design was based on a codon-optimized coding sequence of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models 4 weeks after three injections with 100 μg of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Such immunization induced long-lasting IgG and memory T cell responses in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower or fewer doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific immune responses, as demonstrated by the significant levels of binding IgG antibodies, nAbs and IFN-γ, TNF and IL-2 cytokine production from memory CD8',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been used worldwide to halt spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with E484K mutation shows significant resistance to the neutralization of vaccine sera. To better understand the resistant mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of 26 antibodies to wild-type (WT) spike protein and to the protein harboring E484K mutation, respectively. The results showed that most antibodies (~85%) have weaker binding affinities to the E484K mutated spike protein than to the WT, indicating the high risk of immune evasion of the mutated virus from most of current antibodies. Binding free energy decomposition revealed that the residue E484 forms attraction with most antibodies, while the K484 has repulsion from most antibodies, which should be the main reason of the weaker binding affinities of E484K mutant to most antibodies. Impressively, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination was found to have much stronger binding affinity with E484K mutant than WT, which may work well against the mutated virus. Based on binding free energy decomposition, we predicted that the mutation of four more residues on receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, viz., F490, V483, G485 and S494, may have high risk of immune evasion, which we should pay close attention on during the development of new mAb therapeutics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Along with the nasal epithelium, the lung epithelium is a portal of entry for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and many other respiratory viruses. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus surface spike proteins bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor to facilitate entry into the respiratory epithelium. Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are committed respiratory progenitor cells responsible for the integrity and regeneration of the respiratory epithelium and production of respiratory surfactant proteins. AT2 cells express high levels of surface ACE-2 and thus are a leading target for primary infection by SARS-CoV-2. This study describes a method for directly differentiating telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized human cord blood-derived multi-lineage progenitor cells (MLPCs) to AT2-like cells for the purpose of generating an in vitro cellular platform for viral studies. Differentiation was confirmed with the acquisition of AT2 and absence of alveolar type 1 (AT1) specific markers by confocal microscopy. Expression of the ACE-2 receptor was confirmed by immunofluorescence antibody staining, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and binding of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike and spike 1 proteins. The binding of biotinylated spike proteins was specifically blocked by unlabeled spike proteins and neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the spike protein was internalized after binding to the surface membrane of the cells. The authors defined the culture conditions that enabled AT2-like cells to be repeatedly passaged and cryopreserved without further differentiation to AT1. The authors' method provides a stable and renewable source of AT2 cells for respiratory viral binding, blocking and uptake studies.\",\n",

DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The antibodies recognized and potently neutralized a panel of different Spike variants including Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Eta and A.23.1, but to a lesser extent Beta and Gamma. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co-immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the last year, mass screening campaigns have been carried out to identify immunological response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and establish a possible seroprevalence. The obtained results gained new importance with the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, as the lack of doses has persuaded several countries to introduce different policies for individuals who had a history of COVID-19. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) may represent an affordable tool to support population screening in low-middle-income countries, where diagnostic tests are lacking and epidemiology is still widely unknown. However, LFAs have demonstrated a wide range of performance, and the question of which one could be more valuable in these settings still remains. We evaluated the performance of 11 LFAs in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzing samples collected from 350 subjects. In addition, samples from 57 health care workers collected at 21 to 24\\u2009days after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were also evaluated. LFAs demonstrated a wide range of specificity (92.31% to 100%) and sensitivity (50% to 100%). The analysis of postvaccination samples was used to describe the most suitable tests to detect IgG response against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Tuberculosis (TB) therapy was identified as a potential factor affecting the specificity of LFAs. This analysis identified which LFAs represent a valuable tool not only for the detection of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection but also for the detection of IgG elicited in response to vaccination. These results demonstrated that different LFAs may have different applications and the possible risks of their use in high-TB-burden settings. ',\n",

We determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies-AZD8895 and AZD1061-which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to define the genetic and structural basis of neutralization. AZD8895 forms an 'aromatic cage' at the heavy/light chain interface using germ line-encoded residues in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals. AZD1061 has an unusually long LCDR1; the HCDR3 makes interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of AZD8895. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the crucial binding residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern with regards to virus escape from antibody-mediated neutralization. Both AZD8895 and AZD1061 have strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern with antigenic substitutions in the RBD.

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has made the development of safe and effective vaccines a critical priority. To date, four vaccines have been approved by European and American authorities for preventing COVID-19, but the development of additional vaccine platforms with improved supply and logistics profiles remains a pressing need. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the electroporation of engineered, synthetic cDNA encoding a viral antigen in the skeletal muscle. We constructed a set of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and assessed their immunogenicity in animal models. Among them, COVID-eVax-a DNA plasmid encoding a secreted monomeric form of SARS-CoV-2\\xa0S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-induced the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses (including against the current most common variants of concern) and a robust T\\xa0cell response. Upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice showed reduced weight loss, improved pulmonary function, and lower viral replication in the lungs and brain. COVID-eVax conferred significant protection to ferrets upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In summary, this study identifies COVID-eVax as an ideal COVID-19 vaccine candidate suitable for clinical development. Accordingly, a combined phase I-II trial has recently started.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, which causes COVID-19, has resulted in the death of nearly 4 million people within the last 18 months. While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcαR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (FcγRIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, support the clinical use of currently available antibody-based treatment including the continued study of CCP transfusion strategies.',\n",

These structural studies revealed distinct binding modes for several antibodies, including targeting of rare cryptic epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S that interacts with angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection, as well as the S1 subdomain 1. A potent ACE2-blocking nAb was further engineered to sustain binding to S RBD with the E484K and L452R substitutions found in multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 is a major global health issue and is driving the need for new therapeutics. The surface spike protein, which plays a central role in virus infection, is currently the target for vaccines and neutralizing treatments. The emergence of novel variants with multiple mutations in the spike protein may reduce the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies by altering the binding activity of the protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To understand the impact of spike protein mutations on the binding interactions required for virus infection and the effectiveness of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies, the binding activities of the original spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) sequence and the reported spike protein variants were investigated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In addition, the interactions of the ACE2 receptor, an anti-spike monoclonal antibody (mAb1), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb2), the original spike RBD sequence, and mutants D614G, N501Y, N439K, Y453F, and E484K were assessed. Compared to the original RBD, the Y453F and N501Y mutants displayed a significant increase in ACE2 binding affinity, whereas D614G had a substantial reduction in binding affinity. All mAb-RBD mutant proteins displayed a reduction in binding affinities relative to the original RBD, except for the E484K-mAb1 interaction. The potential neutralizing capability of mAb1 and mAb2 was investigated. Accordingly, mAb1 failed to inhibit the ACE2-RBD interaction and mAb2 inhibited the ACE2-RBD interactions for all RBD mutants, except mutant E484K, which only displayed partial blocking.',\n",

However, currently approved vaccines cannot meet the global demand. In addition, none of the currently used vaccines is administered intranasally to potentially induce mucosal immunity. Here, we tested the safety and immunogenicity of a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that includes a stabilized spike antigen and can be administered intranasally. The vaccine is based on a live Newcastle disease virus vector expressing a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stabilized in a prefusion conformation with six beneficial proline substitutions (AVX/COVID-12-HEXAPRO; Patria). Immunogenicity testing in the pig model showed that both intranasal and intramuscular application of the vaccine as well as a combination of the two induced strong serum neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, substantial reactivity to B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 spike variants was detected. Finally, no adverse reactions were found in the experimental animals at any dose level or delivery route. These results indicate that the experimental vaccine AVX/COVID-12-HEXAPRO (Patria) is safe and highly immunogenic in the pig model. ',\n",

The aim of this study was to assess both humoral and cellular response after a messenger RNA vaccination schedule.\\nEighty-eight consecutive cancer patients treated with programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors were enrolled from the beginning of the vaccination campaign for frail patients. Blood samples for humoral and cell-mediated immune response evaluation were obtained before vaccination (T0), before the second administration (T1) and 21 days after the second dose (T2). The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the percentage of participants showing a significant increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells, measured by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay, after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint is computed together with its exact binomial 95% confidence interval.\\nIn SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects, spike-specific T-cell response was almost undetectable at T0 [median 0.0 interferon-γ (IFN-γ) spot forming units (SFU)/million peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) interquartile range (IQR) 0-7.5] and significantly increased at T1 and T2 (median 15.0 IFN-γ SFU/million PBMC, 25th-75th 0-40 versus 90 IFN-γ SFU/million PBMC, 25th-75th 32.5-224, respectively) (P < 0.001). Focusing on naïve and experienced SARS-CoV-2 subjects, no differences were reported both in terms of CD4- and CD8-specific T-cell response, suggesting that BNT162b2 is able to elicit both adaptive responses after complete vaccination schedule, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was low at T1 in SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects [median 1 : 5 (IQR 1 : 5-1 : 20)] but reached a significantly higher median of 1 : 80 (25th-75th 1 : 20-1 : 160) at T2 (P < 0.0001). Moreover, no COVID-19 cases were documented throughout the period of study.\\nOur data have demonstrated that the administration of a full course of BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a sustained immune response against SARS-CoV-2 regardless of the type of cancer and/or the type of immune checkpoint inhibitors.',\n",

Here, we examined the effect of the 12 most commonly occurring mutations in the\\xa0receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on its expression, stability, activity, and antibody escape potential. Stability was measured using thermal denaturation, and the activity and antibody escape potential were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry in terms of binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and to neutralizing human antibody CC12.1, respectively. Our results show that mutants differ in their expression levels. Of the eight best-expressed mutants, two (N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y) showed stronger affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 compared with the wildtype, whereas four (Y453F, S477N, T478I, and S494P) had similar affinity and two (K417N and E484K) had weaker affinity than the wildtype.

Mutants also differ in their thermal stability, with the two least stable mutants showing reduced expression. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple factors contribute toward the natural selection of variants, and all these factors need to be considered to understand the evolution of the virus.

       "  'abstract': 'mRNA-based vaccines effectively induce protective neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Yet, the kinetics and compositional patterns of vaccine-induced antibody responses to the original strain and emerging variants of concern remain largely unknown. Here we characterized serum antibody classes and subclasses targeting the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type and α, β, γ and δ variants in a longitudinal cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine. We found that mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response with a subclass profile comparable to that induced by natural infection. Importantly, these antibody responses targeted both wild type SARS-CoV-2 as well as its α, β, γ and δ variants. Following primary vaccination, individuals with pre-existing immunity showed higher induction of all antibodies but IgG3 compared to SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects. Unlike naïve individuals, COVID-19 recovered subjects did not mount a recall antibody response upon the second vaccine dose. In these individuals, secondary immunization resulted in a slight reduction of IgG1 against the receptor-binding domain of β and γ variants. Despite the lack of recall humoral response, vaccinees with pre-existing immunity still showed higher titers of IgG1 and IgA to all variants analyzed compared to fully vaccinated naïve individuals. Our findings indicate that mRNA-1273 vaccine triggered cross-variant antibody responses with distinct profiles in vaccinees with or without pre-existing immunity and suggest that individuals with prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection may not benefit from the second mRNA vaccine dose with the current standard regimen.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mutants resulted from the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic have showed resistance to antibody neutralization and vaccine-induced immune response. The present study isolated and identified two novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) from convalescent COVID-19 patients. These two nAbs (XG81 and XG83) were then systemically compared with nine nAbs that were reconstructed by using published data, and revealed that, even though these two nAbs shared targeting epitopes on spike protein, they were different from any of the nine nAbs. Compared with XG81, XG83 exhibited a higher RBD binding affinity and neutralization potency against wild-typed pseudovirus, variant pseudoviruses with mutated spike proteins, such as D614G, E484Q, and A475V, as well as the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. To explore potential broadly neutralizing antibodies, heavy and light chains from all 18 nAbs (16 published nAbs, XG81 and XG83) were cross-recombined, and some of the functional antibodies were screened and studied for RBD binding affinity, and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results demonstrated that several recombined antibodies had a more potent neutralization activity against variant pseudoviruses compared with the originally paired Abs. Taken together, the novel neutralizing antibodies identified in this study are a likely valuable addition to candidate antibody drugs for the development of clinical therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 to minimize mutational escape.',\n",

Here, we report five X-ray crystal structures of sybodies (synthetic nanobodies) including those of binary and ternary complexes of Sb16-RBD, Sb45-RBD, Sb14-RBD-Sb68, and Sb45-RBD-Sb68, as well as unliganded Sb16. These structures reveal that Sb14, Sb16, and Sb45 bind the RBD at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface and that the Sb16 interaction is accompanied by a large conformational adjustment of complementarity-determining region 2. In contrast, Sb68 interacts at the periphery of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface. We also determined cryo-EM structures of Sb45 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Superposition of the X-ray structures of sybodies onto the trimeric spike protein cryo-EM map indicates that some sybodies may bind in both \"up\" and \"down\" configurations, but others may not.

Gilts were mock-bred at 2nd estrus with killed sperm including an intrauterine (i.u.) vaccine comprised of recombinant (r) PEDV Spike protein (rPEDVS1) and L. intracellularis flagellin (rFliC) formulated with poly I:C, host defense peptide, and polyphosphazene (TriAdj). Gilts returned to estrus within 3\\xa0weeks and they were inseminated with killed sperm (3rd estrus) or live sperm (4th estrus) with rPEDVS1-TriAdj vaccine. They also received an i.m. injection of rFliC-TriAdj at 3rd and 4th estrus to establish whether i.u. vaccination primes systemic immunity without inducing mucosal tolerance. Control gilts were administered semen alone at 2nd estrus which allowed us to compare litter weights and sizes to industry standards. Colostrum from gilts challenged with low dose PEDV plus alum was used as positive reference samples for neutralizing antibodies and passive protection. Thirteen weeks later, the i.u.-vaccinated gilts showed significant PEDVS1-specific serum, colostral, and uterine antibody titers and colostral PEDVS1-neutralizing antibodies but poor cell-mediated immunity. Piglets born to i.u. vaccinated gilts received partial passive protection from PEDV infection 3\\xa0days after birth but eventually succumbed to the disease. Immunization by the i.u./i.m. route triggered significant anti-FliC cell-mediated immunity and colostral FliC antibodies that remained high in weaned piglet serum. This trial and a repeat trial wherein gilts were immunized at 1st estrus without semen and at 2nd estrus with live semen showed that intrauterine immunization did not impact fertility, number of live births or piglet growth kinetics.

Potent antibodies recognize exposed variable epitopes, often rendering them ineffective against other sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Class 4 anti-RBD antibodies against a less-exposed, but more-conserved, cryptic epitope could recognize newly emergent zoonotic sarbecoviruses and variants, but they usually show only weak neutralization potencies. Here, we characterize two class 4 anti-RBD antibodies derived from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) donors that exhibit breadth and potent neutralization of zoonotic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. C118-RBD and C022-RBD structures reveal orientations that extend from the cryptic epitope to occlude ACE2 binding and CDRH3-RBD main-chain H-bond interactions that extend an RBD β sheet, thus reducing sensitivity to RBD side-chain changes. A C118-spike trimer structure reveals rotated RBDs that allow access to the cryptic epitope and the potential for intra-spike crosslinking to increase avidity. These studies facilitate vaccine design and illustrate potential advantages of class 4 RBD-binding antibody therapeutics.',\n",

We investigated IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in two groups of recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. The levels of IgM and IgG specific to N and RBD proteins were detected by ELISA.

The assay utility for the discovery of novel inhibitors was demonstrated with a panel of anti-RBD antibodies, ACE2-derived miniproteins and soluble ACE2. Studying the effect of RBD mutations on ACE2 binding showed that the N501Y mutation increased RBD apparent affinity toward ACE2 tenfold that resulted in escaping inhibition by some anti-RBD antibodies. In contrast, while E484K mutation did not highly change the binding affinity, it still escaped antibody inhibition likely due to changes in the epitope recognized by the antibody. Also, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from COVID-19 positive samples from two distinct regions (USA and Brazil) were successfully detected and the results further suggest the persistence of NAbs for at least 6\\xa0months post symptom onset. Finally, sera from vaccinated individuals were tested for NAbs and showed varying neutralizing activity after first and second doses, suggesting the assay can be used to assess immunity of vaccinated populations.

Ecto-domain protein of ACE2 can therefore function as a decoy. Here we show that mutations of S19W, T27W, and N330Y in ACE2 could individually enhance SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD binding. Y330 could be synergistically combined with either W19 or W27, whereas W19 and W27 are mutually unbeneficial. The structures of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD bound to the ACE2 mutants reveal that the enhanced binding is mainly contributed by the van der Waals interactions mediated by the aromatic side-chains from W19, W27, and Y330. While Y330 and W19/W27 are distantly located and devoid of any steric interference, W19 and W27 are shown to orient their side-chains toward each other and to cause steric conflicts, explaining their incompatibility. Finally, using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we demonstrate that these residue substitutions are associated with dramatically improved entry-inhibition efficacy toward both wild-type and antibody-resistant viruses. Taken together, our biochemical and structural data have delineated the basis for the elevated S-RBD binding associated with S19W, T27W, and N330Y mutations in ACE2, paving the way for potential application of these mutants in clinical treatment of COVID-19.',\n",

The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer-antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S-antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S-antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S-antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S-antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S-antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S-antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.',\n",

In this context, we evaluated the development of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in non-vaccinated patients with MM and COVID-19 compared with patients after vaccination with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Serum was collected either four weeks post confirmed diagnosis or four weeks post a second dose of BNT162b2. NAbs were measured with a Food and Drug Administration-approved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodology. Thirty-five patients with COVID-19 and MM along with 35 matched patients were included. The two groups did not differ in age, sex, body mass index, prior lines of therapy, disease status, lymphocyte count, immunoglobulin levels and comorbidities. Patients with MM and COVID-19 showed a superior humoral response compared with vaccinated patients with MM. The median (interquartile range) NAb titre was 87·6% (71·6-94%) and 58·7% (21·4-91·8%) for COVID-19-positive and vaccinated patients, respectively (P\\xa0=\\xa00·01).Importantly, there was no difference in NAb production between COVID-19-positive and vaccinated patients who did not receive any treatment (median NAb 85·1% vs 91·7%, P\\xa0=\\xa00·14). In conclusion, our data indicate that vaccinated patients with MM on treatment without prior COVID-19 should be considered for booster vaccine doses.',\n",

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in serum and saliva of 517 children attending medical services in the Netherlands (irrespective of COVID-19 exposure) from April to October 2020. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N)-specific IgG and IgA were evaluated with an exploratory Luminex assay in serum and saliva and with the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 RBD total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum. Using the Wantai assay, the RBD-specific antibody prevalence in serum was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.9 to 5.3%). With the Luminex assay, we detected heterogeneity between antibodies for S, RBD, and N antigens, as IgG and IgA prevalence ranged between 3.6 and 4.6% in serum and between 0 and 4.4% in saliva. The Luminex assay also revealed differences between serum and saliva, with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG present in saliva but not in serum for 1.5 to 2.7% of all children. Using multiple antigen assays, the IgG prevalence for at least two out of three antigens (S, RBD, or N) in serum or saliva can be calculated as 3.8% (95% CI, 2.3 to 5.6%). Our study displays the heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in children and emphasizes the additional value of saliva antibody detection and the combined use of different antigens.

Since first appearance on December of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has cause extremely high levels of mortality, morbidity, global economic breakdown, and the consequent human suffering. The main diagnostic test for the confirmation of symptomatic individuals is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, serology techniques, such as ELISA are useful to measure the antibodies produced in humans after contact with the virus, as well as the direct presence of viral antigens. In this study we aim to assemble and evaluate four ELISA assays to measure the presence of IgG or IgM specific for the viral Spike protein in COVID-19 patients, using either the full recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or the fragment corresponding to the receptor binding domain. As a control, we analyzed a group of pre-pandemic serum samples obtained before 2017. Strong reactivity was observed against both antigens. A few pre-pandemic samples displayed high OD values, suggesting the possibility of some cross reactivity. All four assays show very good repeatability, both intra- and inter-assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis allowed the definition of cutoffs and evaluation of performance for each ELISA by estimation of the area under the curve. This performance parameter was high for all tests (AUC range: 0.98-0.99). Multiple comparisons between tests revealed no significant difference between each other (P values: 0.24-0.95). Our results show that both antigens are effective to detect both specific IgG and IgM antibodies, with high sensitivity (range 0.92-0.99), specificity (range 0.93-0.97) and congruence with the RT-PCR test (Cohen´s Kappa range 0.87-0.93).

Although being reliable, most of the existing SARS-CoV-2 detection methods cannot be integrated into garments to be used on demand. Here, we report an organic field-effect transistor (OFET)-based biosensing device detecting of both SARS-CoV-2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in less than 20 min. The biosensor was produced by functionalizing an intrinsically stretchable and semiconducting triblock copolymer (TBC) film either with the anti-S1 protein antibodies (S1 Abs) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein, targeting CoV-2-specific RBDs and anti-S1 Abs, respectively. The obtained sensing platform is easy to realize due to the straightforward fabrication of the TBC film and the utilization of the reliable physical adsorption technique for the molecular immobilization. The device demonstrates a high sensitivity of about 19%/dec and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.36 fg/mL for anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies and, at the same time, a sensitivity of 32%/dec and a LOD of 76.61 pg/mL for the virus antigen detection. The TBC used as active layer is soft, has a low modulus of 24 MPa, and can be stretched up to 90% with no crack formation of the film. The TBC is compatible with roll-to-roll printing, potentially enabling the fabrication of low-cost wearable or on-skin diagnostic platforms aiming at point-of-care concepts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global pandemic of the Coronavirus disease in late 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccine development efforts have predominantly been aimed at 'Extra-viral' Spike (S) protein as vaccine vehicles, but there are concerns regarding 'viral immune escape' since multiple mutations may enable the mutated virus strains to escape from immunity against S protein. The 'Intra-viral' Nucleocapsid (N-protein) is relatively conserved among mutant strains of coronaviruses during spread and evolution. Herein, we demonstrate novel vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 by using the whole conserved N-protein or its fragment/peptides. Using ELISA assay, we showed that high titers of specific anti-N antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM) were maintained for a reasonably long duration (> 5 months), suggesting that N-protein is an excellent immunogen to stimulate host immune system and robust B-cell activation. We synthesized three peptides located at the conserved regions of N-protein among CoVs. One peptide showed as a good immunogen for vaccination as well. Cytokine arrays on post-vaccination mouse sera showed progressive up-regulation of various cytokines such as IFN-γ and CCL5, suggesting that TH1 associated responses are also stimulated. Furthermore, vaccinated mice exhibited an elevated memory T cells population.

Compared to the nasopharyngeal swabs, several studies have established saliva as a more amenable specimen type for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the limitations and high demand for COVID-19 testing, we employed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry in the analysis of 60 gargle samples from human donors and compared the resultant spectra against COVID-19 status. Several standards, including isolated human serum immunoglobulins, and controls, such as pre-COVID-19 saliva and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, were simultaneously analyzed to provide a relative view of the saliva and viral proteome as they would appear in this workflow. Five potential biomarker peaks were established that demonstrated high concordance with COVID-19 positive individuals. Overall, the agreement of these results with RT-qPCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs was ≥90% for the studied cohort, which consisted of young and largely asymptomatic student athletes.

Here, two different phage libraries are used to identify immunogenic epitopes across the spike protein and monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Three peptides are further characterized in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and measured their antibody levels in COVID-19 patients, from which one identifies one most immunodominant epitope with the highest antibody response in COVID-19 patients and in immunized mice. More importantly, monoclonal antibodies specifically binding to this peptide isolated from COVID-19 patients have therapeutic potential to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Multivalent VHH-72 nanobodies also display drug-like biophysical properties, including high stability, high solubility, and low levels of non-specific binding.

The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent entry into cells. Mutations in the spike protein (S) are of particular interest due to their potential for reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies or increasing the viral transmissibility and infectivity. Recently, many mutations in the spike protein released new variants, including the Delta and Kappa ones (known as the Indian variants). The variants Delta and Kappa are now of most recent concern because of their well-increased infectivity, both a spin-off of the B.1.617 lineage, which was first identified in India in October 2020. This study employed homology modeling to probe the potential structural effects of the mutations.

       "  'abstract': 'The efficacy of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset ( NCT04348656 ). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500\\u2009ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. In total, 940 patients were randomized, and 921 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) patients in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) patients in the standard of care arm-relative risk (RR) = 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43, P\\u2009=\\u20090.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4% versus 26.4%; RR\\u2009=\\u20091.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.57, P\\u2009=\\u20090.034). The antibody content significantly modulated the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. In multivariate analysis, each standardized log increase in neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity independently reduced the potential harmful effect of plasma (odds ratio (OR)\\u2009=\\u20090.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.95 and OR\\u2009=\\u20090.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.87, respectively), whereas IgG against the full transmembrane spike protein increased it (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.05). Convalescent plasma did not reduce the risk of intubation or death at 30 d in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with unfavorable antibody profiles could be associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to standard care.',\n",

Here, we developed an mRNA vaccine based on the trimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein fused to ferritin-formed nanoparticles (TF-RBD). Compared to the trimeric form of the RBD mRNA vaccine (T-RBD), TF-RBD delivered intramuscularly elicited robust and durable humoral immunity as well as a Th1-biased cellular response. After further challenge with live SARS-CoV-2, immunization with a two-shot low-dose regimen of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in hACE2-transduced mice. In addition, the mRNA template of TF-RBD was easily and quickly engineered into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The TF-RBD multivalent vaccine produced broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants. This mRNA vaccine based on the encoded self-assembled nanoparticle-based trimer RBD provides a reference for the design of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in December 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Several vaccines have been developed to control the COVID-19, but the potential effectiveness of the mucosal vaccine remains to be documented. In this study, we constructed a recombinant L. plantarum LP18:RBD expressing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via the surface anchoring route. The amount of the RBD protein was maximally expressed under the culture condition with 200\\xa0ng/mL of inducer at 33\\xa0°C for 6\\xa0h. Further, we evaluated the immune response in mice via the intranasal administration of LP18:RBD. The results showed that the LP18:RBD significantly elicited RBD-specific mucosal IgA antibodies in respiratory tract and intestinal tract. The percentages of CD3\\xa0+\\xa0CD4+ T cells in spleens of mice administrated with the LP18:RBD were also significantly increased. This indicated that LP18:RBD could induce a humoral immune response at the mucosa, and it could be used as a mucosal vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We provided the first experimental evidence that the recombinant L. plantarum LP18:RBD could initiate immune response in vivo, which implies that the mucosal immunization using recombinant LAB system could be a promising vaccination strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The spike protein is the main protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface. The spike receptor-binding motif mediates recognition of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a critical step in infection, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Posttranslational modifications of the spike receptor-binding motif have been shown to modulate viral infectivity and host immune response, but these modifications are still being explored. Here we studied asparagine deamidation of the spike protein, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, which affect both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 in the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-life of 16.5 and 123\\xa0days at 37 °C, respectively. Deamidation is significantly slowed at 4 °C, indicating a strong dependence of spike protein molecular aging on environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor more than 3.5-fold, yet its high conservation pattern suggests some positive effect on viral fitness. We propose a model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrating how deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif could lead to the accumulation on the virion surface of a nonnegligible chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for molecular aging of the spike protein with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 in humans is caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that belongs to the beta family of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness in 10-15% of infected individuals and mortality in 2-3%. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and to contain viral spread. Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the \"cold chain\" transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS-CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development. Finally, our vaccination regimens generated neutralizing antibodies that partially cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.',\n",

Towards this goal, we sought to identify immunogenic amino acid motifs and linear epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that elicit IgG in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients. Paired pre/post vaccination samples from N = 20 healthy adults, and post-vaccine samples from an additional N = 13 individuals were used to immunoprecipitate IgG targets expressed by a bacterial display random peptide library, and preferentially recognized peptides were mapped to the spike primary sequence. The data identify several distinct amino acid motifs recognized by vaccine-induced IgG, a subset of those targeted by IgG from natural infection, which may mimic 3-dimensional conformation (mimotopes). Dominant linear epitopes were identified in the C-terminal domains of the S1 and S2 subunits (aa 558-569, 627-638, and 1148-1159) which have been previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in vitro and demonstrate identity to bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, but limited homology to non-pathogenic human coronavirus.

This paper presents a design for an in-solution assay pipeline, featuring nanobody-functionalized nanoparticles for rapid, electronic detection (Nano2RED) of Ebola and COVID-19 antigens. Synthetic nanobody binders with high affinity, specificity, and stability are selected from a combinatorial library and site-specifically conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Without requiring any fluorescent labelling, washing, or enzymatic amplification, these multivalent AuNP sensors reliably transduce antigen binding signals upon mixing into physical AuNP aggregation and sedimentation processes, displaying antigen-dependent optical extinction readily detectable by spectrometry or portable electronic circuitry. With Ebola virus secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as targets, Nano2RED showed a high sensitivity (the limit of detection of ∼10\\xa0pg /mL, or 0.13 pM for sGP and ∼40\\xa0pg/mL, or ∼1.3 pM for RBD in diluted human serum), a high specificity, a large dynamic range (∼7 logs),and fast readout within minutes. The rapid detection, low material cost (estimated <$0.01 per test), inexpensive and portable readout system (estimated <$5), and digital data output, make Nano2RED a particularly accessible assay in screening of patient samples towards successful control of infectious diseases.',\n",

Using 85 RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and 79 -negative samples, the MMB-based assay demonstrated similar clinical specificity (98% vs. 99%) and sensitivity (93% vs. 92%) to the ELISA test, but with a much faster turnaround time (45 min vs. 245 min).

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide. However, as soon as the first vaccines-the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far-were released, mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged, raising doubts about their efficiency. This study aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state, in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor, ACE2, rather than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, since the difference observed in the free energy values was small (although more attractive in general). Conversely, the South African/Beta variant (B.1.351), compared with the SARS-CoV-2 wild type (wt), is much more stable in the opened state with one or two RBDs in the up position than in the closed state with three RBDs in the down position favoring the infection. Such results contribute to understanding the natural history of disease and indicate possible strategies for developing new therapeutic molecules and adjusting the vaccine doses for higher B-cell antibody production.',\n",

The relationship between antibody levels and several factors, including age, gender, and hypertension were analyzed. Virus-neutralizing activity in sera was measured to determine the correlation with the levels of antibodies. A chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method to measure IgG against RBD was developed and validated for the clinical setting. The levels of all antibody isotypes were increased after vaccination. Among them, RBD-IgG was dramatically increased after the second vaccination. The IgG levels in females were significantly higher than in males. There was a negative correlation between age and IgG levels in males. The IgG levels significantly correlated with the neutralizing activity. The CLEIA assay measuring IgG against RBD showed a reliable performance and a high correlation with neutralizing activity.

       "  'abstract': 'Background A single dose COVID-19 vaccines, mostly mRNA-based vaccines, are shown to induce robust antibody responses in individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the sufficiency of a single dose to those individuals. However, these important data are limited to developed nations and lacking in resource-limited countries, like Ethiopia. Methods We compared receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG antibodies in 40 SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants and 25 participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We measured the antibody response in post-vaccination blood samples from both groups of participants collected at four different post-vaccination time points: 8- and 12-weeks after each dose of the vaccine administration using an in-house developed ELISA. Results We observed a high level of anti-RBD IgG antibodies titers 8-weeks after a single dose administration (16/27; 59.3%) among naïve participants, albeit dropped significantly (p<0.05) two months later, suggesting the protective immunity elicited by the first dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine will likely last for a minimum of three months. However, as expected, a significant (p<0.001) increase in the level of anti-RBD IgG antibodies titers was observed after the second dose administration in all naïve participants. By contrast, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine-induced anti-RBD IgG antibody titers produced by the P.I participants at 8- to 12-weeks post-single dose vaccination were found to be similar to the antibody titers seen after a two-dose vaccination course among infection- naïve participants and showed no significant (p>0.05) increment following the second dose administration. Conclusion Taken together, our findings show that a single ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals elicits similar antibody responses to that of double dose vaccinated naïve individuals. Age and sex were not associated with the level of vaccine-elicited immune responses in both individuals with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to assess the need for a booster dose to extend the duration and amplitude of the specific protective immune response in Ethiopia settings, especially following the Omicron pandemic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 originated in Wuhan city, China, in 2019 erupted a global pandemic that had put down nearly 3 million lives and hampered the socio-economic conditions of all nations. Despite the available treatments, this disease is not being controlled totally and spreading swiftly. The deadly virus commences infection by hACE2 receptor and its co-receptors (DPP4) engagement with the viral spike protein in the lung alveolar epithelial cells, indicating a primary therapeutic target. The current research attempts to design an in-silico Bispecific antibody (BsAb) against viral spike glycoprotein and DPP4 receptors. Regdanvimab and Begelomab were identified to block the D614G mutated spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and host DPP4 receptor, respectively. The designed BsAb was modified by using KIH (Knobs into Holes) and CrossMAb techniques to prevent heavy chain and light chain mispairings. Following the modifications, the site-specific molecular docking studies were performed, revealing a relatively higher binding affinity of BsAb with spike glycoprotein and DPP4 co-receptor than control BsAb. Also, for blocking the primary entry receptor, hACE2, an anti-viral peptide was linked to the Fc region of BsAb that blocks the hACE2 receptor by linker cleavage inside the infected host. Thus, the designed BsAb and anti-viral peptide therapy could be a promising triumvirate way to obstruct the viral entry by blocking the receptor engagement.',\n",

Many of these new mutations, especially those located in the receptor binding domain, are likely to improve binding to the ACE2 receptor and to avoid binding to antibodies induced by a previous infection or by vaccination. Today there are several different hypotheses about the origin of Omicron, for example that it would have arisen in an immunosuppressed individual. Alternatively, a SARS-CoV-2 variant could have infected an unknown animal, and re-infection of humans would then have occurred. Furthermore, Omicron may have picked up a piece of a human common cold coronavirus.\\xa0 The hitherto available data suggest that the rapid spread of Omicron is a combination of properties of the virus replication ability in addition to its ability to avoid pre-existing immune responses.',\n",

The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses.\\nConfiguration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs = .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 42 vaccinated individuals and an additional N = 13 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months.\\nA competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination. The findings raise concern about the duration of vaccine responses and potential need for booster shots.\",\n",

Every country has made great efforts to struggle against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including massive vaccination, immunological patients' surveillance, and the utilization of convalescence plasma for COVID-19 therapy. These efforts are associated with the attempts to increase the titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Abs (nAbs) generated either after infection or vaccination that represent the body's immune status. As there is no standard therapy for COVID-19 yet, virus eradication will mainly depend on these nAbs contents in the body. Therefore, serological nAbs neutralization assays become a requirement for researchers and clinicians to measure nAbs titers. Different platforms have been developed to evaluate nAbs titers utilizing various epitopes sources, including neutralization assays based on the live virus, pseudovirus, and neutralization assays utilizing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein receptor binding site, receptor-binding domain. As a standard neutralization assay, the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) requires isolation and propagation of live pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 virus conducted in a BSL-3 containment. Hence, other surrogate neutralization assays relevant to the PRNT play important alternatives that offer better safety besides facilitating high throughput analyses. This review discusses the current neutralization assay platforms used to evaluate nAbs, their techniques, advantages, and limitations.\",\n",

However, a homologous inactivated vaccine booster or a heterologous booster with protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) significantly increased neutralization titers to both WT and Omicron variant. Moreover, at day 14 post the third dose, neutralizing antibody titer reduction for Omicron was less than that for convalescents or individuals who had only two doses of the vaccine, indicating that a homologous or heterologous booster can reduce the Omicron escape from neutralizing.

       "  'abstract': 'Two doses of mRNA vaccination have shown >94% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 mostly in naïve adults, but it is not clear if the second dose is needed to maximize effectiveness in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and what other factors affect responsiveness.\\nWe measured IgA, IgG and IgM levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens from the wild-type and S from the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern, after BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination in a cohort of health care workers (N=578). Neutralizing capacity and antibody avidity were evaluated. Data were analyzed in relation to COVID-19 history, comorbidities, vaccine doses, brand and adverse events.\\nVaccination induced robust IgA and IgG levels against all S antigens. Neutralization capacity and S IgA and IgG levels were higher in mRNA-1273 vaccinees, previously SARS-CoV-2 exposed, particularly if symptomatic, and in those experiencing systemic adverse effects (p<0·05). A second dose in pre-exposed did not increase antibody levels. Smoking and comorbidities were associated with 43% (95% CI, 19-59) and 45% (95% CI, 63-18) lower neutralization, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 3-57%) and 55% (95% CI, 33-70%) lower antibody levels, respectively. Among fully vaccinated, 6·3% breakthroughs were detected up to 189 days post-vaccination. Among pre-exposed non-vaccinated, 90% were IgG seropositive more than 300 days post-infection.\\nOur data support administering a single-dose in pre-exposed healthy individuals as primary vaccination. However, heterogeneity of responses suggests that personalized recommendations may be necessary depending on COVID-19 history and life-style. Higher mRNA-1273 immunogenicity would be beneficial for those expected to respond worse to vaccination and in face of variants that escape immunity such as Omicron. Persistence of antibody levels in pre-exposed unvaccinated indicates maintenance of immunity up to one year.\\nThis work was supported by Institut de Salut Global de Barcelona (ISGlobal) internal funds, in-kind contributions from Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, the Fundació Privada Daniel Bravo Andreu, and European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Health (grant number 20877), supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, a body of the European Union receiving support from the H2020 Research and Innovation Programme.

       "  'abstract': 'Variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge, posing great challenges in outbreak prevention and control. It is important to understand in advance the impact of possible variants of concern (VOCs) on infectivity and antigenicity. Here, we constructed one or more of the 15 high-frequency naturally occurring amino acid changes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants. Single mutant of A520S, V367F, and S494P in above three VOCs enhanced infectivity in ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells of different species, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells. Aggregation of multiple RBD mutations significantly reduces the infectivity of the possible three VOCs. Regarding neutralization, it is noteworthy that E484K, N501Y, K417N, and N439K predispose to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) protection failure in the 15 high-frequency mutations. Most importantly, almost all possible VOCs (single RBD mutation or aggregation of multiple mutations) showed no more than a 4-fold decrease in neutralizing activity with convalescent sera, vaccine sera, and immune sera of guinea pigs with different immunogens, and no significant antigenic drift was formed. In conclusion, our pseudovirus results could reduce the concern that the aggregation of multiple high-frequency mutations in the RBD of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 variants does not lead to severe antigenic drift, and this would provide value for vaccine development strategies.

       "  'abstract': \"The current COVID-19 global pandemic poses immense challenges to global health, largely due to the difficulty to detect infection in the early stages of the disease, as well as the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. Research and understanding of the human immune system can provide important theoretical and technical support for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, the clinical implementations of which include immunoassays and immunotherapy, which play a crucial role in the fight against the pandemic. This review consolidates the current scientific evidence for immunoassay, which includes multiple methods of detecting antigen and antibody against SARS-CoV-2. We compared the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and clinical applications of these three detection techniques. In addition to detecting viral infections, knowledge on the body's immunity against the virus is desirable; thus, the immunotherapy-based neutralizing antibody (nAb) detection methods were discussed. We also gave a brief introduction to the new immunoassay technology such as biosensing. This was followed by an in-depth and extensive review on a variety of immunotherapy methods. It includes convalescent plasma therapy, neutralizing antibody-based treatments targeting different regions of SARS-CoV-2, immunotherapy targeted on the host cell including inhibiting the host cell receptor and cytokine storm, as well as cocktail antibodies, cross-neutralizing antibodies, and immunotherapy based on cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and autoepitopes and autoantibody. Despite the development of various immunological testing methods and antibody therapies, the current global situation of COVID-19 is still tense. We need more efficient detection methods and more reliable antibody therapies. The up-to-date knowledge on therapeutic strategies will likely help clinicians worldwide to protect patients from life-threatening viral infections.\",\n",

Anti-spike seropositivity in anti-CD20 patients was significantly correlated with CD19+ B cell levels and inversely correlated with cumulative treatment duration.

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via its spike protein binding to its surface receptor on target cells and results in acute symptoms involving especially the lungs known as COVID-19. However, increasing evidence indicates that many patients develop a chronic condition characterized by fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms, termed long-COVID. Most of the vaccines produced so far for COVID-19 direct mammalian cells via either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to express the spike protein, or administer recombinant spike protein, which is recognized by the immune system leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recent publications provide new findings that may help decipher the pathogenesis of long-COVID. One paper reported perivascular inflammation in brains of deceased patients with COVID-19, while others showed that the spike protein could damage the endothelium in an animal model, that it could disrupt an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and that it can cross the BBB resulting in perivascular inflammation. Moreover, the spike protein appears to share antigenic epitopes with human molecular chaperons resulting in autoimmunity and can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, some antibodies produced against the spike protein may not be neutralizing, but may change its conformation rendering it more likely to bind to its receptor. As a result, one wonders whether the spike protein entering the brain or being expressed by brain cells could activate microglia, alone or together with inflammatory cytokines, since protective antibodies could not cross the BBB, leading to neuro-inflammation and contributing to long-COVID. Hence, there is urgent need to better understand the neurotoxic effects of the spike protein and to consider possible interventions to mitigate spike protein-related detrimental effects to the brain, possibly via use of small natural molecules, especially the flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.',\n",

We have previously reported the highly efficient production of RBD in Pichia pastoris, which is structurally similar to the same protein produced in mammalian HEK-293T cells. In this work we designed an RBD multimer with the purpose of increasing its immunogenicity. We produced multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between RBD expressed in P. pastoris and Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very stable decameric 170\\xa0kDa protein. Such particles were used to vaccinate mice with two doses 30\\xa0days apart. When the particles ratio of RBD to BLS units was high (6-7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer in average), the humoral immune response was significantly higher than that elicited by RBD alone or by RBD-BLS particles with a lower RBD to BLS ratio (1-2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, multimeric particles with a high number of RBD copies elicited a high titer of neutralizing IgGs. These results indicate that multimeric particles composed of RBD covalent coupled to BLS possess an advantageous architecture for antigen presentation to the immune system, and therefore enhancing RBD immunogenicity. Thus, multimeric RBD-BLS particles are promising candidates for a protein-based vaccine.',\n",

Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent patients or individuals vaccinated with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) with 12- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1 (Astra Zeneca-Oxford)/BNT162b2 vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike.

For sera collected early after the onset of symptoms (within 15\\xa0days) IgG/IgA-FCI also returned the highest number of positive results (52/72; 72.2%). Positive percent agreement between FCI and compared immunoassays was highest for Roche ECLIA, ranging from 96.1 (IgG/IgA-FCI) to 97.7% (IgG-FCI), whereas negative percent agreement was higher between FCI and Diasosin CLIA, regardless of antibody isotype. The data suggest that FCI may outperform Roche ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA in terms of clinical sensitivity for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tracking the evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through genomic surveillance programs is undoubtedly one of the key priorities in the current pandemic situation. Although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations at a slower rate compared with other RNA viruses, evolutionary pressures derived from the widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population have progressively favored the global emergence, though natural selection, of several variants of concern that carry multiple non-synonymous mutations in the spike glycoprotein. These are often placed in key sites within major antibody epitopes and may therefore confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, or otherwise compensate infectivity deficits associated with other non-synonymous substitutions. As previously shown by other authors, several emerging variants carry recurrent deletion regions (RDRs) that display a partial overlap with antibody epitopes located in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Comparatively, very little attention had been directed towards spike insertion mutations prior to the emergence of the B.1.1.529 (omicron) lineage. This manuscript describes a single recurrent insertion region (RIR1) in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, characterized by at least 49 independent acquisitions of 1-8 additional codons between Val213 and Leu216 in different viral lineages. Even though RIR1 is unlikely to confer antibody escape, its association with two distinct formerly widespread lineages (A.2.5 and B.1.214.2), with the quickly spreading omicron and with other VOCs and VOIs warrants further investigation concerning its effects on spike structure and viral infectivity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1965 healthcare workers, of which 381 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in most participants, 96%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 91% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 80% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers. Both anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels were significantly higher in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients four months post infection than in healthcare workers four months post infection (p = 2*10-23 and 2*10-13 respectively). Although the magnitude of humoral response was associated with disease severity, our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies is pivotal for a thorough understating of its evolution during infection. The recent deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, which elicit protective anti-spike neutralizing antibodies, has stressed the importance of uncovering and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated spike proteins. Sequencing databases have allowed to follow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are circulating in the human population, and several experimental platforms were developed to study these variants. However, less is known about the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are developed in the respiratory system of the infected individual. To gain further insight on SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis during natural infection, we preformed single-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from nose-throat swabs of infected individuals. Interestingly, intra-host SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated S genes or N genes were detected in all individuals who were analyzed. These intra-host variants were present in low frequencies in the swab samples and were rarely documented in current sequencing databases. Further examination of representative spike variants identified by our analysis showed that these variants have impaired infectivity capacity and that the mutated variants showed varied sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent plasma and to plasma from vaccinated individuals. Notably, analysis of the plasma neutralization activity against these variants showed that the L1197I mutation at the S2 subunit of the spike can affect the plasma neutralization activity. Together, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variants should be further analyzed for a more thorough characterization of potential circulating variants.',\n",

To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring the vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase.

Thus, there is an urgent need to roll out COVID-19 vaccines to children of all ages. However, whether children respond equivalently to adults to mRNA vaccines and whether dosing will elicit optimal immunity remains unclear. Given the recent announcement of incomplete immunity induced by the pediatric dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in young children, here we aimed to deeply profile and compare the vaccine-induced humoral immune response in 6-11 year old children receiving the pediatric (50μg) or adult (100μg) dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared to adults and naturally infected children or children that experienced multi inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) for the first time. Children elicited an IgG dominant vaccine induced immune response, surpassing adults at a matched 100μg dose, but more variable immunity at a 50μg dose. Irrespective of titer, children generated antibodies with enhanced Fc-receptor binding capacity. Moreover, like adults, children generated cross-VOC humoral immunity, marked by a decline of omicron receptor binding domain-binding, but robustly preserved omicron Spike-receptor binding, with robustly preserved Fc-receptor binding capabilities, in a dose dependent manner. These data indicate that while both 50μg and 100μg of mRNA vaccination in children elicits robust cross-VOC antibody responses, 100ug of mRNA in children results in highly preserved omicron-specific functional humoral immunity.\\nmRNA vaccination elicits robust humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children 6-11 years of age.',\n",

Here we determine the structures of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 convalescent patients in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes (YLQ and RLQ).

With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single-dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10\\u2009days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to results for control animals. While both i.m. and i.n. vaccination induced neutralizing antibody titers, only i.m. vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of i.m. vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrate that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study. ',\n",

To address this, high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif. Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays, this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, including with a P681R mutation, and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction.

The highly transmissible infection can be contained only by accurate diagnosis, quarantining, and exercising social distancing. Therefore, quick and massive deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing plays a crucial role in the identification and isolation of infected patients. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for COVID-19 detection; however, it needs expertise, facilities, and time. Hence, for the ease of population-wide screening, serology-based diagnostic assays were introduced. These can help determine the prevalence of infection, understand the epidemiology of the disease, and assist in suitable public health interventions while being user-friendly and less time consuming. Although serological testing kits in markets soared, their sensitivity and specificity were questioned in reports from different parts of the world. In this article, we have reviewed 40 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CE-approved clinically evaluated serological kits (8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] kits, 10 chemiluminescent immunoassay [CLIA] kits, and 22 lateral flow immunoassay [LFIA] kits) for their sensitivity and specificity and discussed the apparent reasons behind their performance. We observed appreciable sensitivity in the kits detecting total antibodies compared to the kits targeting single isotype antibodies. Tests that determined antibodies against nucleocapsid protein were found to be more sensitive and those detecting antibodies against spike protein were found to have greater specificity. This study was conducted to help the decision-making while acquiring antibody kits and concurrently to be mindful of their shortcomings.',\n",

Here, we comprehensively characterized various parameters of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in 126 individuals under real-world conditions. After two doses of vaccination, S-receptor binding domain IgG (S-RBD IgG) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) were detected in 87.06% (74/85) and 78.82% (67/85) of individuals, respectively. Female participants developed higher concentrations of S-RBD IgG and NAb compared to male vaccinees. Interestingly, a longer dosing interval between the first and second vaccination resulted in a better long-term SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG response. The frequencies of CD4+ T cells that produce effector cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) in response to stimulation with peptide pools corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) or membrane (M) protein were significantly higher in individuals received two doses of vaccine than those received one dose of vaccine and unvaccinated individuals.

Detection and vaccination are essential for disease control, but they are distinct and complex operations that require significant improvements. Here, we developed an integrated detection and vaccination system to greatly simplify these efforts. We constructed recombinant baculoviruses to separately display the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Insect cells infected by the recombinant baculoviruses were used to generate a cell-based system to accurately detect patient serum. Notably, although well-recognized by our newly developed detection system in which S-displaying insect cells acted as antigen, anti-S antibodies from many patients were barely detectable by Western blot, evidencing that COVID-19 patients primarily produce conformation-dependent anti-S antibodies. Furthermore, the same baculovirus constructs can display N (N-Bac) or S (S-Bac) on the baculovirus envelope and serve as vector vaccines. Animal experiments show that S-Bac or N-Bac immunization in mice elicited a strong and specific antibody response, and S-Bac in particular stimulated effective neutralizing antibodies without the need for adjuvant. Our integrated system maintains antigen conformation and membrane structure to facilitate serum detection and antibody stimulation. Thus, compared with currently available technologies, our system represents a simplified and efficient platform for better SARS-CoV-2 detection and vaccination.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Seventeen years after the epidemic of SARS coronavirus, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2-emerged resulting in an unprecedented pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the SARS coronavirus. Despite many similarities to SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher affinity to ACE2 and shows higher infectivity and transmissibility, resulting in explosive increase of infected people and COVID-19 patients. Emergence of the variants harboring mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein has drawn critical attention to the interaction between ACE2 and Spike and the efficacies of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase which degrades angiotensin II, B1-bradykinin, or apelin, and thereby is a critical regulator of cardiovascular physiology and pathology. In addition, the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by viral and non-viral pneumonias, aspiration, or sepsis. Upon infection, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses downregulates ACE2 expression, likely associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS. Thus, ACE2 is not only the SARS-CoV-2 receptor but might also play an important role in multiple aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis and possibly post-COVID-19 syndromes. Soluble forms of recombinant ACE2 are currently utilized as a pan-variant decoy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and a supplementation of ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Here, we review the role of ACE2 in the pathology of ARDS in COVID-19 and the potential application of recombinant ACE2 protein for treating COVID-19.',\n",

From August 2021 onwards, India experienced a progressive decline in the number of active SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicative of a downward trend in the explosive second wave. This prospective study was conducted quarterly for one year (May 2020 to June 2021) at a tertiary care hospital in the city of Pune in western India. Receptor-binding domain (RBD, n = 319) and full genome (n = 20) sequences from viral-RNA-positive nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients representing the first and second waves were used for analysis. No Brazilian, South African, or California variants were detected in this study. Until December 2020, only the wild-type strain was prevalent. Concurrent with the upsurge of the second wave in March 2021, 73% (33/45) of RBD sequences harboured L452R/E484Q mutations characteristic of the Kappa variant. In April 2021, co-circulation of Kappa (37%) and Delta (L452R/T478K, 59%) variants was recorded. During May and June 2021, the Delta variant became the predominant circulating variant, and this coincided with a significant decline in the number of COVID-19 cases. Of the 20 full genome sequences, six isolates each exhibited signature mutations of the Kappa and Delta variant. With several states witnessing a reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, continuous monitoring of newer mutations and assessment of their effect on virus transmissibility and their impact on vaccinated or previously exposed individuals is necessary.',\n",

In the present study, a DNA vaccine candidate was generated by combining in tandem envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of dengue virus serotypes 1-4 and a DENV-2 NS1 protein coding region. Each domain was designed as a serotype-specific consensus coding sequence derived from different genotypes based on whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates in India and complemented with data from Africa. This sequence was further optimized for protein expression. In silico structural analysis of the EDIII consensus sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic. Vaccination of mice with this construct induced pan-serotype neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cell responses. Assaying of intracellular IFN-γ staining, immunoglobulin IgG2(a/c)/IgG1 ratios and immune gene profiling suggest a strong Th1-dominant immune response. Finally, passive transfer of immune sera protected AG129 mice challenged with a virulent, non-mouse adapted DENV-2 strain.

To analyze the impact of this atypic mutational landscape, we constructed a complete structure of the omicron spike protein. Compared with the delta variant, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of omicron has an increased electrostatic surface potential, but a decreased affinity for the ACE-2 receptor. The N-terminal domain (NTD) has both a decreased surface potential and a lower affinity for lipid rafts. The omicron variant is predicted to be less fusogenic and thus less pathogenic than delta, due to a geometric reorganization of the S1-S2 cleavage site. Overall, these virological parameters suggest that omicron does not have a significant infectivity advantage over the delta variant. However, in omicron, neutralizing epitopes are greatly affected, suggesting that current vaccines will probably confer little protection against this variant. In conclusion, the puzzling mutational pattern of the omicron variant combines contradictory properties which may either decrease (virological properties) or increase (immunological escape/facilitation) the transmission of this variant in the human population. This Janus-like phenotype may explain some conflicting reports on the initial assessment of omicron and provide new insights about the molecular mechanisms controlling its dissemination and pathogenesis worldwide.',\n",

In conclusion, BNT162B2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 induced potent and comparable humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses, peaking between 10 and 30 days after complete immunization. A single dose of any vaccine did not induce adequate protection in a great part of donors, making the shorter interval between mRNA vaccine doses preferable in the settings of increased risk of infection.',\n",

In this study, epitope screening was performed using a panel of overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequences of the RBD and NP proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from 66 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that while reactivity of patients' sera with reduced recombinant RBD protein was significantly lower than the native form of RBD (p<0.001), no significant differences were observed for reactivity of patients' sera with reduced and non-reduced NP protein. Pepscan analysis revealed weak to moderate reactivity towards different RBD peptide pools, which was more focused on peptides encompassing aa 181-223 of RBD. NP peptides, however, displayed strong reactivity with a single peptide covering aa 151-170. These findings were confirmed by peptide depletion experiments using both ELISA and Western blotting. Altogether, our data suggest involvement of mostly conformational disulfide bond-dependent immunodominant epitopes in RBD-specific antibody response, while the IgG response to NP is dominated by linear epitopes. Identification of dominant immunogenic epitopes in NP and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 could provide important information for the development of passive and active immunotherapy as well as diagnostic tools for the control of COVID-19 infection.\",\n",

The virus enters via nasopharynx, oral and infects cells by the expression of the spike protein, and enters the lungs using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor. The spectrum of specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is increasingly challenging as frequent mutations have been reported and their antigen specificity varies accordingly. The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will have a more significant advantage in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity. Recently, mAbs have been developed to target specific neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of the therapeutic index of mAbs that can elicit neutralization by binding to the viral spike protein and suppress the cytokine network is a classic therapeutic approach for a potential cure. The development of mAbs against B-cell function as well as inhibition of the cytokine network has also been a focus in recent research. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mAbs as antibody cocktail preparations against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Target specific therapeutic accomplishment with mAbs, a milestone in the modern therapeutic age, can be used to achieve a specific therapeutic strategy to suppress SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. This review focuses on the molecular aspects of the cytokine network and antibody formation to better understand the development of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

We investigated 55 vaccine breakthrough infection cases (mostly Delta) in Singapore, comparing them against 86 vaccinated close contacts who did not contract infection. Vaccine breakthrough cases showed lower memory B cell frequencies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Compared to plasma antibodies, antibodies secreted by memory B cells retained a higher fraction of neutralizing properties against the Delta variant. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF were lower in vaccine breakthrough infections than primary infection of similar disease severity, underscoring the usefulness of vaccination in preventing inflammation.

Unfortunately, massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations, including people living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein (A.1) from SARS-CoV-2 (repRNA-CoV2S) in immunocompromised, SIV infected and immune competent, naïve pigtail macaques. Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naïve animals. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals.',\n",

MERS-CoV infects via the respiratory route; thus, we conjugated the Co4B ligand to the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD), and used this to intranasally immunize C57BL/6 and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice. Ag-specific mucosal immunoglobulin (Ig) A and systemic IgG, together with virus-neutralizing activities, were highly induced in mice immunized with Co4B-conjugated S-RBD (S-RBD-Co4B) compared to those immunized with unconjugated S-RBD. Ag-specific T cell-mediated immunity was also induced in the spleen and lungs of mice intranasally immunized with S-RBD-Co4B. Intranasal immunization of hDPP4-Tg mice with S-RBD-Co4B reduced immune cell infiltration into the tissues of virus-challenged mice. Finally, S-RBD-Co4B-immunized mice exhibited were better protected against infection, more likely to survive, and exhibited less body weight loss.

The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data and extensively validated by experimental results on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus or about 2.8 times as infectious as the Delta variant. On the basis of 185 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may have an 88% likelihood to escape current vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from AstraZeneca, Regeneron mAb cocktail, Celltrion, and Rockefeller University. However, its impacts on GlaxoSmithKline's sotrovimab appear to be mild.

       "  'abstract': 'Antibodies (Abs) are essential for the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and all the vaccines developed so far have been designed to induce Abs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Many studies have examined Ab responses in the blood from vaccinated and infected individuals. However, since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, it is also critical to understand the mucosal Ab responses at the sites of initial virus exposure. Here, we examined plasma versus saliva Ab responses in vaccinated and convalescent patients. Although saliva levels were significantly lower, a strong correlation was observed between plasma and saliva total Ig levels against all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested. Virus-specific IgG1 responses predominated in both saliva and plasma, while a lower prevalence of IgM and IgA1 Abs was observed in saliva. Antiviral activities of plasma Abs were also studied. Neutralization titers against the initial WA1 (D614G), B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) strains were similar but lower against the B.1.351 (beta) strain. Spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activities were also detected and the levels correlated with spike-binding Ig titers. Interestingly, while neutralization and ADCP potencies of vaccinated and convalescent groups were comparable, enhanced complement deposition to spike-specific Abs was noted in vaccinated versus convalescent groups and corresponded with higher levels of IgG1 plus IgG3 among the vaccinated individuals. Altogether, this study demonstrates the detection of Ab responses after vaccination or infection in plasma and saliva that correlate significantly, although Ig isotypic differences were noted. The induced plasma Abs displayed Fab-mediated and Fc-dependent functions with comparable neutralization and ADCP potencies, but a greater capacity to activate complement was elicited upon vaccination.',\n",

Various serological immunoassays based on different analytical techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ELISA; chemiluminescence immunoassay, CLIA; electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, ECLIA; and lateral flow immunoassay, LFI), epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (nucleocapsid, N; receptor-binding domain, RBD; extended RBD, RBD+; S1 or S2 domain of the spike [S] protein, S1/S2), and antibody subtypes (IgG, pan-Ig) were conducted. A positive real-time PCR test from a nasopharyngeal swab was defined as previous COVID-19. Neutralization assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a subgroup of patients to assess neutralization activity (n\\xa0=\\xa0201).\\nThe sensitivity to detect patients with previous COVID-19 was ≥85% in anti-N ECLIA (86.8%) and anti-S1 ELISA (86.2%). Sensitivity was 84.7% in anti-S1/S2 CLIA, 84.0% in anti-RBD+LFI, 81.0% in anti-N CLIA, 79.2% in anti-RBD ELISA, and 65.6% in anti-N ELISA.

       "  'abstract': 'The highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 253 million people, claiming ∼ 5.1 million lives to date. Although mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, and vaccinations help curb viral transmission, there is a pressing need for cost-effective systems to mitigate the viral spread. Here, we present a generic strategy for capturing SARS-CoV-2 through functionalized cellulose materials. Specifically, we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody (Nb) targeting the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The immobilization of the fusion proteins on cellulose substrates enhanced the capture efficiency of Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses of the wildtype and the D614G variant, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose to capture viruses from complex fluids in a continuous fashion. By capturing and containing viruses through the Nb-functionalized cellulose, our work may find utilities in virus sampling and filtration towards paper-based diagnostics, environmental tracking of viral spread and reducing viral load from infected individuals.

Noninvasive sampling methods are advantageous for reducing the need for venipuncture, which may be a barrier to investigations, particularly in pediatric populations. Oral fluids are obtained by gingiva-crevicular sampling from children and adults and are very well accepted. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) based on these samples have acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional serum-based antibody EIAs and are suitable for population-based surveillance. We describe the development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG EIAs using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike (S) proteins in IgG isotype capture format and an indirect receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG EIA, intended for use in children as a primary endpoint. All three assays were assessed using a panel of 1,999 paired serum and oral fluids from children and adults participating in school SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies during and after the first and second pandemic wave in the United Kingdom. The anti-NP IgG capture assay was the best candidate, with an overall sensitivity of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71 to 79%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI: 78 to 99%) compared with paired serum antibodies.

       "  'abstract': 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an exceptional public health crisis that demands the timely creation of new therapeutics and viral detection. Owing to their high specificity and reliability, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as powerful tools to treat and detect numerous diseases. Hence, many researchers have begun to urgently develop Ab-based kits for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ab drugs for use as COVID-19 therapeutic agents. The detailed structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known, and since this protein is key for viral infection, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) has become a major target for therapeutic Ab development. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with a high mutation rate, especially under the selective pressure of aggressively deployed prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing Abs, the use of Ab cocktails is expected to be an important strategy for effective COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection may stimulate an overactive immune response, resulting in a cytokine storm that drives severe disease progression. Abs to combat cytokine storms have also been under intense development as treatments for COVID-19. In addition to their use as drugs, Abs are currently being utilized in SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, including antigen and immunoglobulin tests. Such Ab-based detection tests are crucial surveillance tools that can be used to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Herein, we highlight some key points regarding mAb-based detection tests and treatments for the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

Passage of mAb-containing serum through the affinity membrane results in mAb capture within 1 min. Subsequent rinsing, binding of a secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore, and a second rinse yield mAb-concentration-dependent fluorescence intensities in the wells. Calibration curves established from analyses on different days have low variability and allow determination of mAb levels in separately prepared samples with an average error <10%, although errors in single-replicate measurements may reach 40%. The assays can occur in diluted serum with physiologically relevant mAb concentrations, as well as in undiluted serum.

These data argue that alternative immune mechanisms, beyond neutralization, may continue to confer protection against severe disease. Beyond their ability to bind and block infection, antibodies contribute to control and clearance of multiple infections via their ability to direct antiviral immunity via Fc-effector mechanisms. Thus, here we probed the ability of vaccine induced antibodies, across three COVID-19 vaccines, to drive Fc-effector activity against Omicron. Despite the significant loss of IgM, IgA and IgG binding to the Omicron Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) across BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccines, stable isotype binding was observed across all of these vaccines to the Omicron Spike. Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a significant loss of cross RBD-specific antibody Fcγ-receptor binding by the CoronaVac vaccine, but preservation of RBD-specific FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding across the mRNA vaccines. Conversely, Spike-specific antibodies exhibited persistent binding to Fcγ-receptors, across all three vaccines, albeit higher binding was observed with the mRNA vaccines, marked by a selective preservation of FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding antibodies. Thus, despite the significant to near complete loss of Omicron neutralization across several vaccine platforms against Omicron, vaccine induced Spike-specific antibodies continue to recognize the virus and recruit Fc-receptors pointing to a persistent capacity for extra-neutralizing antibodies to contribute Omicron disease attenuation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"COVID-19 has affected billions of people around the world directly or indirectly. The response to the pandemic has focused on preventing the spread of the disease and improving treatment options. Diagnostic technologies have played a key role in this response since the beginning of the pandemic. As vaccines and other treatments have been developed and deployed, interest in understanding and measuring the individual level of immune protection has increased. Historically, use of antibody titers to measure systemic immunity has been constrained by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between antibodies and immunity, the lack of international standards for antibody concentration to enable cross-study comparisons, and insufficient clinical data to allow for the development of robust antibody-immunity models. However, these constraints have recently shifted. With a deeper understanding of antibodies, the promulgation of WHO antibody standards, and the development of immunity models using datasets from multiple COVID-19 vaccine trials, certain types of quantitative antibody tests may now provide a way to monitor individual or community immunity against COVID-19. Specifically, tests that quantitate the concentration of anti-RBD IgG -antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the S1 spike protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - show promise as a useful and scalable measure of the COVID-19 immunity of both individuals and communities. However, to fulfill this promise, a rapid and easy-to-administer test is needed. To address this important clinical need, Brevitest deployed its point-of-care-capable technology platform that can run a rapid (<15 minute), quantitative antibody test with a sample of 10 μl of whole blood from a fingerstick. The test we validated on this platform measures the concentration of anti-RBD IgG in Binding Antibody Units per milliliter (BAU/mL) per WHO Reference Standard NIBSC 20/136. In this paper, we present studies used to characterize the Brevitest anti-RBD IgG assay and evaluate its clinical performance, lower limits of measurement, precision, linearity, interference, and cross-reactivity. The results demonstrate the ability of this assay to measure a patient's anti-RBD IgG concentration. This information, together with models developed from recent COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, can provide a means of assessing the current level of immune protection of an individual or community against COVID-19 infection.\",\n",

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron showed increased infectivity relative to B.1, B.1.1 and similar to Delta, a property conferred by S and N protein mutations. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with tozinameran (Pfizer/BioNTech), elasomeran (Moderna), Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had moderately to dramatically reduced efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine antisera showed strong neutralizing activity against VLPs possessing the ancestral spike protein (B.1, B.1.1), with 3-fold reduced efficacy against Delta and 15-fold lower neutralization against Omicron VLPs. Johnson & Johnson antisera showed minimal neutralization of any of the VLPs tested. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics Casirivimab and Imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1, B.1.1 or Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs. Our results suggest that Omicron is at least as efficient at assembly and cell entry as Delta, and the antibody response triggered by existing vaccines or previous infection, at least prior to boost, will have limited ability to neutralize Omicron. In addition, some currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 along with its high number of mutations in the spike gene has raised alarm about the effectiveness of current medical countermeasures. To address this concern, we measured neutralizing antibodies against Omicron in three important settings: (1) post-vaccination sera after two and three immunizations with the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine, (2) convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by different variants, and (3) clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies. Using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, we found that titers against Omicron were low or undetectable after two immunizations and in most convalescent sera. A booster vaccination significantly increased titers against Omicron to levels comparable to those seen against the ancestral (D614G) variant after two immunizations. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in post-vaccination antibody responses. Only three of 24 therapeutic antibodies tested retained their full potency against Omicron and high-level resistance was seen against fifteen. These findings underscore the potential benefit of booster mRNA vaccines for protection against Omicron and the need for additional therapeutic antibodies that are more robust to highly mutated variants.\\nThird dose of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine significantly boosts neutralizing antibodies to the Omicron variant compared to a second dose, while neutralization of Omicron by convalescent sera, two-dose vaccine-elicited sera, or therapeutic antibodies is variable and often low.',\n",

Here, we used an authentic live virus neutralization assay to examine the neutralizing activity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant against mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses. Following the 2nd dose, we observed a 30-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant. Through six months after the 2nd dose, none of the sera from naïve vaccinated subjects showed neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. In contrast, recovered vaccinated individuals showed a 22-fold reduction with more than half of the subjects retaining neutralizing antibody responses. Following a booster shot (3rd dose), we observed a 14-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant and over 90% of boosted subjects showed neutralizing activity against the omicron variant.

The recent emergence of B.1.1.529, the Omicron variant1,2, which has more than 30 mutations in the spike protein, has raised concerns for escape from protection by vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. A key test for potential countermeasures against B.1.1.529 is their activity in pre-clinical rodent models of respiratory tract disease. Here, using the collaborative network of the SARS-CoV-2 Assessment of Viral Evolution (SAVE) program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), we evaluated the ability of multiple B.1.1.529 Omicron isolates to cause infection and disease in immunocompetent and human ACE2 (hACE2) expressing mice and hamsters. Despite modeling and binding data suggesting that B.1.1.529 spike can bind more avidly to murine ACE2, we observed attenuation of infection in 129, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice as compared with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, with limited weight loss and lower viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Although K18-hACE2 transgenic mice sustained infection in the lungs, these animals did not lose weight. In wild-type and hACE2 transgenic hamsters, lung infection, clinical disease, and pathology with B.1.1.529 also were milder compared to historical isolates or other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Overall, experiments from multiple independent laboratories of the SAVE/NIAID network with several different B.1.1.529 isolates demonstrate attenuated lung disease in rodents, which parallels preliminary human clinical data.',\n",

Results The S-IgG antibody titers (AU/mL) measured using both the Abbott and Fujirebio assays increased significantly (p<0.001) over time, both with a prevalence of 100% at 35 days after the first vaccination. The multivariate log-normal linear regression analysis indicated the effect of immunosuppressant medication using both the Abbott (p=0.013) and Fujirebio (p=0.039) assays on S-IgG levels after complete vaccination.

Antibodies to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured in serum 2-4 weeks after the second and third doses. Vaccine-elicited T-cell responses were assessed in vitro using blood samples taken before and 7-10 days after the second dose and 3 weeks after the third dose from a subset of patients by stimulating cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike protein peptides. The main outcomes were the proportions of participants with serological responses (anti-RBD antibody concentrations of ≥70 AU/mL) and T-cell responses to spike peptides following two and three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04798625, and is ongoing.\\nBetween Feb 9, 2021, and May 27, 2021, 90 patients were enrolled, 87 of whom donated serum and were included in our analyses (69 [79·3%] women and 18 [20·7%] men). 1114 healthy controls were included (854 [76·7%] women and 260 [23·3%] men). 49 patients were allotted a third vaccine dose. 19 (21·8%) of 87 patients, compared with 1096 (98·4%) of 1114 healthy controls, had a serological response after two doses (p<0·0001).

We opted to assess the SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity in recovered children and adolescents, addressing the pediatrics specific immunity towards COVID-19. Two independent assays were performed to investigate humoral and cellular immunological memory in pediatric convalescent COVID-19 patients. Specifically, RBD IgG, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell responses were identified and quantified in recovered children and adolescents. SARS-CoV-2-specific RBD IgG detected in recovered patients had a half-life of 121.6 days and estimated duration of 7.9 months compared with baseline levels in controls. The specific T cell response was shown to be independent of days after diagnosis. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed robust responses not only to spike (S) peptides (a main target of vaccine platforms) but were also similarly activated when stimulated by membrane (M) and nuclear (N) peptides. Importantly, we found the differences in the adaptive responses were correlated with the age of the recovered patients. The CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 S peptide in children aged <12 years correlated with higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels, suggesting the importance of a T cell-dependent humoral response in younger children under 12 years. Both cellular and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infections can be induced in pediatric patients. Our important findings provide fundamental knowledge on the immune memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 in recovered pediatric patients.',\n",

We isolated and analyzed 126 monoclonal antibodies, many of which were sarbecovirus cross-reactive, with some displaying merbecovirus- and embecovirus-reactivity. Several isolated broadly neutralizing antibodies were effective against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429, B.1.617, and B.1.617.2 variants and 19 prominent potential escape sites. Furthermore, assembly of 716,806 SARS-CoV-2 sequences predicted emerging escape variants, which were also effectively neutralized. One of these broadly neutralizing potent antibodies, R40-1G8, is a IGHV3-53 RBD-class-1 antibody. Remarkably, cryo-EM analysis revealed that R40-1G8 has a flexible binding mode, targeting both \"up\" and \"down\" conformations of the RBD.

According to the mass-action law, a lesser concentration of tightly binding antibody can produce the same quantity of antibody-antigen complexes as higher concentrations of lower affinity antibody. Thus, measurements of antibody levels reflect both affinity and concentration. These two fundamental parameters cannot be disentangled in clinical immunoassays, and so produce a bias which depends on the assay format.\\nTo determine the apparent affinity of anti-spike protein antibodies, a small number of antigen-coated magnetic microparticles were imaged by fluorescence microscopy after probing antigen-antibody equilibria directly in patient plasma.

We have collected serial samples from 23 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms and measured the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory samples and markers of inflammation in serum samples. We monitored seroconversion during the acute phase of illness and quantitated the amount of total IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and estimated the virus neutralization potential of these antibodies. Viral load decreased by day 8 in all the patients but the detection of viral RNA in saliva samples did not correlate well with viral RNA detection in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples. 25% of the virus-positive patients had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in the serum and in other cases, the efficiency of antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 strain was lower as compared to the circulating virus isolate. Decrease in viral load coincided with increase in neutralizing antibodies and interferon levels in serum. Most patients showed no increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β or IL-6, however, elevated levels of IL-7 and other inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-8 was observed. These data suggest that most mild infections are associated with absence of inflammation coupled with an active innate immune response, T-cell activation and neutralizing antibodies.',\n",

Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care (POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, which we refer to as 'NanoSpot.ai', is suitable for POC testing, can be manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens.\",\n",

Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency are at increased risk of persistent infection. This challenging clinical scenario is associated with adverse patient outcome and potentially creates an ecological niche for the evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion capacity. Case reports and/or series have implied a therapeutic role for convalescent plasma (CP) to secure virological clearance, although concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of CP and its potential to drive viral evolution, and it has largely been withdrawn from clinical use in the UK.\\nWe report two cases in which persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared following administration of the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2, Ronapreve). A 55-year-old male with follicular lymphoma, treated with B cell depleting therapy, developed SARS-CoV-2 infection in September 2020 which then persisted for over 200\\xa0days. He was hospitalised on four occasions with COVID-19 and suffered debilitating fatigue and malaise throughout. There was no clinical response to antiviral therapy with remdesivir or CP, and SARS-CoV-2 was consistently detected in nasopharyngeal swabs. Intrahost evolution of several spike variants of uncertain significance was identified by viral sequence analysis. Delivery of REGN-COV2, in combination with remdesivir, was associated with clinical improvement and viral clearance within 6\\xa0days, which was sustained for over 150\\xa0days despite immunotherapy for relapsed follicular lymphoma.

Several major variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and posed challenges in controlling the pandemic. The recently occurred Omicron variant raised serious concerns about reducing the efficacy of vaccines and neutralization antibodies due to its vast mutations. We have modelled the complex structure of the human ACE2 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Omicron Spike protein (S-protein), and conducted atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding interactions. The analysis shows that the Omicron RBD binds more strongly to the human ACE2 protein than the original strain. The mutations at the ACE2-RBD interface enhance the tight binding by increasing hydrogen bonding interaction and enlarging buried solvent accessible surface area.',\n",

In this study, we use pseudoviruses and reveal that the spike protein of the Lambda variant is more infectious than that of other variants due to the T76I and L452Q mutations. The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, a unique 7-amino acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda spike protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies and further augments antibody-mediated enhancement of infection. Although this mutation generates a nascent N-linked glycosylation site, the additional N-linked glycan is dispensable for the virological property conferred by this mutation. Since the Lambda variant has dominantly spread according to the increasing frequency of the isolates harboring the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, our data suggest that the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is closely associated with the substantial spread of the Lambda variant in South America.',\n",

Therefore, we analyzed samples from the same individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We found hCCCoV antibody levels increase after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, demonstrating cross-reactivity. However, a case-control study indicates that baseline hCCCoV antibody levels are not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in mice. Together, these data suggest that pre-existing hCCCoV antibodies hinder SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based immunity following infection and provide insight on how pre-existing coronavirus immunity impacts SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical considering emerging variants.',\n",

In this study, various immuno-informatics tools and bioinformatics databases were deployed to derive consensus B-cell and T-cell epitope sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This approach has identified four potential epitopes which have the capability to initiate both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, are non-allergenic and do not trigger autoimmunity. These peptide sequences were also evaluated to show 99.82% of global population coverage based on the genotypic frequencies of HLA binding alleles for both MHC class-I and class-II and are unique for SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human as a host species. Epitope number 2 alone had a global population coverage of 98.2%. Therefore, we further validated binding and interaction of its constituent T-cell epitopes with their corresponding HLA proteins using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, followed by binding free energy calculations with molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area, essential dynamics analysis and free energy landscape analysis.

Whether the viral antibodies exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is still not fully understood. Here, we conducted in vitro assessment of whether convalescent serum enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection or induced excessive immune responses in immune cells. Our data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells, macrophages and monocytes, which express variable levels of FcγR, could be enhanced by convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients. We also determined the factors associated with ADE, and found which showed a time-dependent but not viral-dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the ADE effect is not associated with the neutralizing titer or RBD antibody level when testing serum samples collected from different patients. However, it is higher in a medium level than low or high dilutions in a given sample that showed ADE effect, which is similar to dengue. Finally, we demonstrated more viral genes or dysregulated host immune gene expression under ADE conditions compared to the no-serum infection group. Collectively, our study provides insight into the understanding of an association of high viral antibody titer and severe lung pathology in severe patients with COVID-19.',\n",

In this study, the concentration of antibodies (ABs) against both the S- and the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as serum neutralization activity were evaluated in three patients after a mild course of COVID-19. Serum samples were collected frequently during a period of over one year. Furthermore, in two individuals, the effects of an additional vaccination with a mRNA vaccine containing the S1-RBD sequence on these antibodies were examined. After natural infection, the antibodies (IgA, IgG) against the S1-protein remained elevated above the established cut-off to positivity (S-IgA 60 BAU/mL and S-IgG 50 BAU/mL, respectively) for over a year in all patients, while this was not the case for ABs against the N-protein (cut-off N-IgG 40 BAU/mL, N-IgA 256 BAU/mL). Sera from all patients retained the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 for more than a year. Vaccination resulted in a rapid boost of antibodies to S1-protein but, as expected, not to the N-protein. Most likely, the wide use of the WHO reference preparation will be very useful in determining the individual immune status of patients after an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or after vaccination.',\n",

The procedure requires a small amount of S-protein/RBD and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). A high-throughput, simple ELISA technique is employed. Plate-coated-RBDs are allowed to interact with the serum, then soluble ACE2 is added, followed by secondary antibodies and substrate. The key steps in this procedure include (1) serum heat treatment to prevent non-specific interactions, (2) proper use of blank controls to detect side reactions and eliminate secondary antibody cross-reactivity, (3) the addition of an optimal amount of saturating ACE2 to maximize sensitivity and prevent non-competitive co-occurrence of RBD-ACE2 binding and neutralization, and (4) mechanistically derived neutralization calculation using a calibration curve. Even manually, the protocol can be completed in 16 h for >30 serum samples; this includes the 7.5 h of incubation time. This automatable, high-throughput, competitive ELISA assay can screen a large number of sera, and does not require sterile conditions or special containment measures, as live viruses are not employed. In comparison to the 'gold standard' assays (virus neutralization titers (VNT) or plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT)), which are laborious and time consuming and require special containment measures due to their use of live viruses.

Yellow fever virus 17D (YF17D) is a live-attenuated virus vaccine with an impressive efficacy record in humans, and therefore, it is a very attractive platform for the development of novel chimeric vaccines against various pathogens. In the present study, we generated a YF17D-based replicon vaccine platform by replacing the prM and E surface proteins of YF17D with antigenic subdomains from the spike (S) proteins of three different betacoronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV. The prM and E proteins were provided in trans for the packaging of these RNA replicons into single-round infectious particles capable of expressing coronavirus antigens in infected cells. YF17D replicon particles expressing the S1 regions of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike proteins were immunogenic in mice and elicited (neutralizing) antibody responses against both the YF17D vector and the coronavirus inserts. Thus, YF17D replicon-based vaccines, and their potential DNA- or mRNA-based derivatives, may constitute a promising and particularly safe vaccine platform for current and future emerging coronaviruses.',\n",

Sixteen pwMS treated with ocrelizumab or rituximab received a third homologous SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, either the Moderna mRNA-1273 or Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine. We quantified the response of IgG antibodies against the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 four weeks later. An antibody titer of 100 AU/mL or more was considered clinically relevant.

Using a peptide array-based approach, we analysed the binding of antibodies from Comirnaty-elicited, convalescent, and control sera to the peptides covering the spike protein. A total of 37 linear epitopes were identified. A total of 26 of these epitopes were almost exclusively recognized by the convalescent sera. Mapping these epitopes to the spike structures revealed that most of these 26 epitopes are masked in the pre-fusion structure. In particular, in the conserved central helix, three epitopes that are only exposed in the post-fusion conformation were identified.

       "  'abstract': 'The development of preventive vaccines became the first order task in the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. This paper reports the construction of the pVAX-RBD plasmid containing the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the S protein and a unique signal sequence 176 which promotes target protein secretion into the extracellular space thereby increasing the efficiency of humoral immune response activation. A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate (PGS) was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells. The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice. In particular, RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1 : 1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1 : 42\\u2009000, in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group. The pVAX-RBD‒PGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response. Using ELISpot, it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF-γ in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool. The results suggest that the polyglucine-spermidine conjugate-enveloped pVAX-RBD construct may be considered as a promising DNA vaccine against COVID-19.',\n",

In this study, we serially measured the serum titers of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies generated against the nucleocapsid protein (NCP), S1 subunit of the spike protein (S1), and receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in Japanese individuals with COVID-19. Among the IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies, IgA antibodies against all of the aforementioned viral proteins were the first to appear after the infection, and IgG and/or IgA seroconversion often preceded IgM seroconversion. In regard to the timeline of the antibody responses to the different viral proteins (NCP, S1 and RBD), IgA against NCP appeared than IgA against S1 or RBD, while IgM and IgG against S1 appeared earlier than IgM/IgG against NCP or RBD. The IgG responses to all three viral proteins and responses of all three antibody classes to S1 and RBD were sustained for longer durations than the IgA/IgM responses to all three viral proteins and responses of all three antibody classes to NCP, respectively. The seroconversion of IgA against NCP occurred later and less frequently in patients with mild COVID-19.

The aim of this work is to study the production of circulating immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with past infection in Cyprus. Individuals of the general population, with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, were invited to visit the Biobank at the Center of Excellence in Biobanking and Biomedical Research of the University of Cyprus. Serum IgG antibodies were measured using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assays of Abbott Laboratories. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were also evaluated against participants' demographic and clinical data. All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata 16. The median levels of receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG in 969 unvaccinated individuals, who were reportedly infected between November 2020 and September 2021, were 432.1 arbitrary units (AI)/mL (interquartile range-IQR: 182.4-1147.3). Higher antibody levels were observed in older participants, males, and those who reportedly developed symptoms or were hospitalized. The RBD-specific IgG levels peaked at three months post symptom onset and subsequently decreased up to month six, with a slower decay thereafter. IgG response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is bi-phasic with considerable titer variability. Levels of IgG are significantly associated with several parameters, including age, gender, and severity of symptoms.\",\n",

This study aims to evaluate the potential of indirect immunofluorescence as an in-house diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 antigens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Three primary antibodies raised from mice were used for immunofluorescence staining, including monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Smears of cells from NPS of 29 COVID-19 patients and 20 non-infected individuals, and cells from viral culture were stained by the three antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify respiratory epithelial cells with positive signals. Polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 N protein had the highest sensitivity and specificity among the three antibodies tested, detecting 17 out of 29 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other tested viruses except SARS-CoV. Detection of virus-infected cells targeting SARS-CoV-2 N protein allow identification of infected individuals, although accuracy is limited by sample quality and number of respiratory epithelial cells. The potential of immunofluorescence as a simple diagnostic method was demonstrated, which could be applied by incorporating antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into multiplex immunofluorescence panels used clinically, such as for respiratory viruses, thus allowing additional routine testing for diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 even after the epidemic has ended with low prevalence of COVID-19.',\n",

Here, we report a dual-detection fluorescent immunochromatographic assay (DFIA), with a built-in self-calibration process, that enables rapid quantitative detection of neutralizing antibodies that block binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, this assay is based on the inhibition of binding between ACE2 and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by neutralizing antibodies, and the affinity of anti-human immunoglobulins for these neutralizing antibodies. Our self-calibrating DFIA shows improved precision and sensitivity with a wider dynamic linear range, due to the incorporation of a ratiometric algorithm of two-reverse linkage signals responding to an analyte. This was evident by the fact that no positive results (0/14) were observed in verified negative samples, while 22 positives were detected in 23 samples from verified convalescent plasma. A comparative analysis of the ability to detect neutralizing antibodies in 266 clinical serum samples including those from vaccine recipients, indicated that the overall percent agreement between DFIA and the commercial ELISA kit was 90.98%. Thus, the proposed DFIA provides a more reliable and accurate rapid test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations in the community. Therefore, the DFIA based strategy for detecting biomarkers, which uses a ratiometric algorithm based on affinity and inhibition reactions, may be applied to improve the performance of immunochromatographic assays.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Costimulatory and coinhibitory mechanisms appear to be involved throughout immune responses to control their specificity and level. Many mechanisms operate; therefore, various theoretical models should be considered complementary rather than competing. One such coinhibitory model, pictured in 1971, involves the crosslinking of antigen receptors with inhibitory Fc receptors by antigen/antibody complexes. This model was prompted by observations that the Fc portion of antibody was required for potent suppression of immune responses by antibody. The signal via the antigen receptor wakes up T or B cells, providing specificity, while costimulators and coinhibitors stimulate or inhibit these awoken cells. The recent observations that administration of monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in early COVID-19 patients inhibits the induction of clinically damaging autoimmune antibodies suggest they may provide negative Fc signals that are blocked in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the reduced ability of SARS-CoV-2 antigen to localize to germinal centres in COVID-19 patients also suggests a block in binding of the Fc of antibody bound to antigen on FcγRIIb of follicular dendritic cells. The distinction between self and foreign is made not only at the beginning of immune responses but also throughout, and involves multiple mechanisms and models. There are past beginnings (history of models) and current and future beginnings for solving serious clinical problems (such as COVID-19) and different types of models used for understanding the complexities of fundamental immunology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged towards the end of 2019 that caused a severe respiratory disease in humans called COVID-19. It led to a pandemic with a high rate of morbidity and mortality that is ongoing and threatening humankind. Most of the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are synonymous or deleterious, but a few of them produce improved viral functions. The first known mutation associated with higher transmissibility, D614G, was detected in early 2020. Since then, the virus has evolved; new mutations have occurred, and many variants have been described. Depending on the genes affected and the location of the mutations, they could provide altered infectivity, transmissibility, or immune escape. To date, mutations that cause variations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been among the most studied because of the protein's role in the initial virus-cell contact and because it is the most variable region in the virus genome. Some concerning mutations associated with an impact on viral fitness have been described in the Spike protein, such as D614G, N501Y, E484K, K417N/T, L452R, and P681R, among others. To understand the impact of the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus, the mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has been under constant global scrutiny. The virus variants are defined according to their origin, their genetic profile (some characteristic mutations prevalent in the lineage), and the severity of the disease they produce, which determines the level of concern. If they increase fitness, new variants can outcompete others in the population. The Alpha variant was more transmissible than previous versions and quickly spread globally. The Beta and Gamma variants accumulated mutations that partially escape the immune defenses and affect the effectiveness of vaccines. Nowadays, the Delta variant, identified around March 2021, has spread and displaced the other variants, becoming the most concerning of all lineages that have emerged. The Delta variant has a particular genetic profile, bearing unique mutations, such as T478K in the spike protein and M203R in the nucleocapsid. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the different mutations that have appeared in SARS-CoV-2, mainly on the spike protein. It analyzes their impact on the protein function and, subsequently, on the level of concern of different variants and their importance in the ongoing pandemic.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for pathogen detection methods that combine low detection limits with rapid results. Despite the significant progress in methods and devices for nucleic acid amplification, immunochemical methods are still preferred for mass testing without specialized laboratories and highly qualified personnel. The most widely used immunoassays are microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with photometric detection and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) with visual results assessment. However, the disadvantage of ELISA is its considerable duration, and that of LFIA is its low sensitivity. In this study, the modified LFIA of a specific antigen of the causative agent of COVID-19, spike receptor-binding domain, was developed and characterized. This modified LFIA includes the use of gold nanoparticles with immobilized antibodies and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotag and registration of the nanotag binding by SERS spectrometry. To enhance the sensitivity of LFIA-SERS analysis, we determined the optimal compositions of SERS nanotags and membranes used in LFIA. For benchmark comparison, ELISA and conventional colorimetric LFIA were used with the same immune reagents. The proposed method combines a low detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL (at 0.4 ng/mL for ELISA and 1 ng/mL for qualitative LFIA) with a short assay time equal to 20 min (at 3.5 h for ELISA and 15 min for LFIA). The results obtained demonstrate the promise of using the SERS effects in membrane immuno-analytical systems.',\n",

The measurements were performed with the GenScript's cPassTM SARS-CoV-2 NAbs Detection Kit (GenScript, Inc.; Piscataway, NJ) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH; Mannheim, Germany). Three hundred nine participants with a median age of 48 years were included. A gradual decline in both NAbs and anti-S-RBD IgGs became evident from 2 weeks to 9 months postvaccination. Both NAbs and anti-S-RBD IgGs levels were significantly lower at 9 months compared with the previous timepoints. Interestingly, age was found to exert a statistically significant effect on NAbs elimination only during the first-trimester postvaccination, as older age was associated with a more rapid clearance of NAbs. Furthermore, simulation studies predicted that the median NAb value would fall from 66% at 9 months to 59% and 45% at 12 and 18 months postvaccination, respectively. This finding may reflect a declining degree of immune protection against COVID-19 and advocates for the administration of booster vaccine shots especially in areas with emerging outbreaks.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally mild or asymptomatic in children but a biological basis for this outcome is unclear. Here we compare antibody and cellular immunity in children (aged 3-11 years) and adults. Antibody responses against spike protein were high in children and seroconversion boosted responses against seasonal Beta-coronaviruses through cross-recognition of the S2 domain. Neutralization of viral variants was comparable between children and adults. Spike-specific T cell responses were more than twice as high in children and were also detected in many seronegative children, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive responses to seasonal coronaviruses. Importantly, children retained antibody and cellular responses 6 months after infection, whereas relative waning occurred in adults. Spike-specific responses were also broadly stable beyond 12 months. Therefore, children generate robust, cross-reactive and sustained immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 with focused specificity for the spike protein. These findings provide insight into the relative clinical protection that occurs in most children and might help to guide the design of pediatric vaccination regimens.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than is SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the authentic variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccinee sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.',\n",

Especially individuals over 60 years of age or with underlying co-morbidities including heart or lung disease, and diabetes or immune compromised patients are at higher risk. Fatal multi-organ damage in COVID19 patients can be attributed to Interleukin (IL-)6 dominated cytokine storm. Consequently, IL-6R monoclonal antibody treatment for severe COVID19 cases has been approved for therapy. High concentrations of soluble IL-6R were found in COVID19 intensive care unit patients suggesting the involvement of IL-6 trans-signaling in disease pathology. Here, in analogy to bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), we developed the first bispecific IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor c19s130Fc which blocks viral infection and IL-6 trans-signaling. c19s130Fc is a designer protein of the IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor cs130 fused to a single domain nanobody directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. c19s130Fc binds with high affinity to IL-6:sIL6R complexes as well as the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 as shown by surface plasmon resonance. Using cell-based assays, we demonstrate that c19s130Fc blocks IL-6 trans-signaling-induced proliferation and STAT3 phosphorylation of Ba/F3-gp130 cells as well as SARS-CoV2 infection and STAT3 phosphorylation in Vero cells. Taken together, c19s130Fc represents a new class of bispecific inhibitors consisting of a soluble cytokine receptor fused to anti-viral nanobodies and principally demonstrates the multi-functionalization of trans-signaling inhibitors.

Although IgM/IgG serology assay has been widely used, with the entire spike or nucleocapsid antigens, they only indicate the presence or absence of antibodies against these proteins but are not specific to the neutralization antibodies, therefore providing only generic information about infection stage and possible future immune protection. Novel technologies enabling easy-to-use and sensitive detection of multiple specific antibodies simultaneously will facilitate precise diagnosis of infection stage, prediction of clinical outcomes, and evaluation of future immune protection upon viral exposure or vaccination. Here, we demonstrate a rapid and ultrasensitive quantification method for epitope-specific antibodies, including different isotypes and subclasses, in a multiplexed manner. Using an ultrabright fluorescent nanolabel, plasmonic-fluor, this novel assay can be completed in 20 min and more importantly, the limit of detection of the plasmon-enhanced immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is as much as 100-fold lower compared to the assays relying on enzymatic amplification of colorimetric signals. Using convalescent patient plasma, we demonstrate that this biodetection method reveals the patient-to-patient variability in immune response as evidenced by the variations in whole protein and epitope-specific antibodies. This cost-effective, rapid, and ultrasensitive plasmonically enhanced multiplexed epitope-specific serological assay has the potential to be broadly employed in the detection of specific antibodies, which may benefit the advanced epidemiology studies and enable improvement of the clinical outcomes and prediction of the future protection against the SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"ACE2 is a membrane protein that regulates the cardiovascular system. Additionally, ACE2 acts as a receptor for host cell infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that emerged as the cause of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and has brought unprecedented burden to economy and health. ACE2 binds the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and shows little variation in amino acid sequence meaning natural resistance is rare. The discovery of a novel short ACE2 isoform (deltaACE2) provides evidence for inter-individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity, and likelihood of developing subsequent 'Long COVID'. Critically, deltaACE2 loses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding sites in the extracellular domain, and is predicted to confer reduced susceptibility to viral infection. We aimed to assess the differential expression of full-length ACE2 versus deltaACE2 in a panel of human tissues (kidney, heart, lung, and liver) that are implicated in COVID-19, and confirm ACE2 protein in these tissues. Using dual antibody staining, we show that deltaACE2 localises, and is enriched, in lung airway epithelia and bile duct epithelia in the liver. Finally, we also confirm that a fluorescently tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monomer shows low binding at lung and bile duct epithelia where dACE2 is enriched.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is enormous ongoing interest in characterizing the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant of Concern (VOC) (B.1.1.529), which continues to spread towards potential dominance worldwide. To aid these studies, based on the wealth of available structural information about several SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and a modeling pipeline we have previously developed for tracking the ongoing global evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we provide a set of computed structural models (henceforth models) of the Omicron VOC receptor-binding domain (omRBD) bound to its corresponding receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE2) and a variety of therapeutic entities, including neutralizing and therapeutic antibodies targeting previously-detected viral strains. We generated bound omRBD models using both experimentally-determined structures in the PDB as well as machine learningbased structure predictions as starting points. Examination of ACE2-bound omRBD models reveals an interdigitated multi-residue interaction network formed by omRBD-specific substituted residues (R493, S496, Y501, R498) and ACE2 residues at the interface, which was not present in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. Emergence of this interaction network suggests optimization of a key region of the binding interface, and positive cooperativity among various sites of residue substitutions in omRBD mediating ACE2 binding. Examination of neutralizing antibody complexes for Barnes Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies modeled with omRBD highlights an overall loss of interfacial interactions (with gain of new interactions in rare cases) mediated by substituted residues. Many of these substitutions have previously been found to independently dampen or even ablate antibody binding, and perhaps mediate antibody-mediated neutralization escape ( ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Kappa and Beta variants with enhanced transmissibility and resistance to neutralizing antibodies has created new challenges for the control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the structural nature of Kappa and Beta spike (S) proteins and their association with ACE2 is of significant importance. Here we present two cryo-EM structures for each of the Kappa and Beta spikes in the open and open-prone transition states. Compared with wild-type (WT) or G614 spikes, the two variant spikes appear more untwisted/open especially for Beta, and display a considerable population shift towards the open state as well as more pronounced conformational dynamics. Moreover, we capture four conformational states of the S-trimer/ACE2 complex for each of the two variants, revealing an enlarged conformational landscape for the Kappa and Beta S-ACE2 complexes and pronounced population shift towards the three RBDs up conformation. These results implicate that the mutations in Kappa and Beta may modify the kinetics of receptor binding and viral fusion to improve virus fitness. Combined with biochemical analysis, our structural study shows that the two variants are enabled to efficiently interact with ACE2 receptor despite their sensitive ACE2 binding surface is modified to escape recognition by some potent neutralizing MAbs. Our findings shed new light on the pathogenicity and immune evasion mechanism of the Beta and Kappa variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, as dangerous mutations emerge, there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The spike glycoprotein on the virus envelope binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells through its receptor binding domain (RBD) to mediate virus entry. Thus, blocking this interaction may inhibit viral entry and consequently stop infection. Here, we generated fusion proteins composed of the extracellular portions of ACE2 and RBD fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (ACE2-Ig and RBD-Ig, respectively). We demonstrate that ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active and that it can be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits in-vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection better than ACE2-Ig. Mechanistically, we show that anti-spike antibody generation, ACE2 enzymatic activity, and ACE2 surface expression were not affected by RBD-Ig. Finally, we show that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig at neutralizing high virus titers. We thus propose that RBD-Ig physically blocks virus infection by binding to ACE2 and that RBD-Ig should be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.',\n",

Recently, we identified high-affinity neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) specific for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of detailed epitope mapping, we generate two biparatopic Nbs (bipNbs) targeting a conserved epitope outside and two different epitopes inside the RBD:ACE2 interface. Both bipNbs bind all currently circulating VOCs with high affinities and are capable to neutralize cellular infection with VOC B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) in vitro. To assess if the bipNbs NM1267 and NM1268 confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo, human ACE2 transgenic mice are treated intranasally before infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 B.1, B.1.351 (Beta) or B.1.617.2 (Delta). Nb-treated mice show significantly reduced disease progression and increased survival rates. Histopathological analyses further reveal a drastically reduced viral load and inflammatory response in lungs.

       "  'abstract': 'Since its onset, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has manifested multiple paradoxes related to both complications of the infection and treatment resistance. The experiences in therapy started from the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and anti-cytokine therapy (anti IL-6, anti-TNF-alpha and CCR5) up to experiments of immunomodulation with glucocorticoids and proposal of very powerful immunomodulatory drugs like cyclophosphamide in optimized diagrams in order to induce the depression of the immune hyperergic reaction with the maintenance of TH and TC lymphocyte resistance to keep the anti-viral activity in the absence of an etiological treatment. In this context, also the second major immunologic mechanism could function: the molecular mimicry - cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and various antigenic determinants from the body, other than the tissue structures of the respiratory system. In a similar manner, in the past, genital staphylococcal infections among women wearing tampons, sometimes generated a toxic-septic shock with an unexpected evolution to death. It is also about an atypical cytokine storm, generated by the staphylococcal toxins (super-antigenic) but probably, the aggressiveness was also generated by the cross reactivity with chemical antigens from the cotton fibers, because this disorder generally appeared among women in the menstrual period, sometimes the local genital infection being minor. Moreover, with the lapse of time, the reaction of shock no longer appeared, probable through the increase of immunologic tolerance to cotton fibers. In a similar manner, in COVID-19 a reaction of hyper-sensitivity to a gaseous antigen could overlap, considering the decrease of tolerance at the invasive administration of oxygen (the contact with BALT - the lymphatic system associated to the bronchia, where the resident macrophage is the siderophage) and partial maintenance at the non-invasive administration through mask or extracorporeal, which induces the first contact with the lymphatic elements associated to the oropharyngeal cavity or blood, where the siderophage can no longer be observed. In this context, some adult patients with COVID-19 could manifest an immunologic genetic defect of TS at BALT level, as women with staphylococcal toxic-septic shock had a local defect at the VALT level (lymphatic tissue associated with the genital tract). In children, the syndrome is rare and more multisystem, which rather suggests the breaking of central tolerance through the lack of intra-thymus or intra-medullary deletion of the auto-reactive clones of (Th TC), while among adults the defect seems to be more peripheral, local, with the involvement of TS and resident macrophages (siderophages). This could explain not only the higher level of severity in elder patients and those with cardiac disorders but also the rarity of the pathology in patients aged under nine years.',\n",

This study analyzes the evolutionary background of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-2) in accordance with its close relative SARS-CoV (SARS-1), which was emerged in 2002. A comparative genomic and proteomic study was conducted on SARS-2, SARS-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which was emerged in 2012. In silico analysis inferred the genetic variability among the tested viruses. The SARS-1 genome harbored 11 genes encoding 12 proteins, while SARS-2 genome contained only 10 genes encoding for 10 proteins. MERS genome contained 11 genes encoding 11 proteins. The analysis also revealed a slight variation in the whole genome size of SARS-2 comparing to its siblings resulting from sequential insertions and deletions (indels) throughout the viral genome particularly ORF1AB, spike, ORF10 and ORF8. The effective indels were observed in the gene encoding the spike protein that is responsible for viral attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and initiating infection. These indels are responsible for the newly emerging COVID-19 variants αCoV, βCoV, γCoV and δCoV. Nowadays, few effective COVID-19 vaccines developed based on spike (S) glycoprotein were approved and become available worldwide. Currently available vaccines can relatively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and suppress the disease. The traditional (killed or attenuated virus vaccine and antibody-based vaccine) and innovated vaccine production technologies (RNA- and DNA-based vaccines and viral vectors) are summarized in this review.

These may alter the antigenic structure of S, causing escape from natural or vaccine-induced immunity. Beta is particularly difficult to neutralize using serum induced by early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains and is most antigenically separated from Delta. To understand this, we generated 674 mAbs from Beta-infected individuals and performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the 27 most potent mAbs: one binding the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), the rest the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two of these RBD-binding mAbs recognize a neutralizing epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, while 18 target mutated residues in Beta: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. There is a major response to N501Y, including a public IgVH4-39 sequence, with E484K and K417N also targeted. Recognition of these key residues underscores why serum from Beta cases poorly neutralizes early pandemic and Delta viruses.',\n",

The BNT162b2/Pfizer and mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccines represent new vaccine technology relying on administration of mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein encased in lipid nanoparticles. The vaccines are administered as two doses into muscle, which elicits a strong response, typically within 14 days after the second dose. Neuromuscular diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of muscle and are often treated with chronic glucocorticoid steroids, both of which may contribute to a blunted immune response to vaccination. Here, we measured IgG antibody content and neutralizing antibody response after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in non-ambulatory neuromuscular disease patients. After two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, median anti-receptor binding domain IgG and percent surrogate viral neutralization in non-ambulatory neuromuscular disease samples were significantly elevated similar to healthy vaccinated controls. As in healthy controls, COVID-19 vaccines produce greater antibody levels compared to those with a history of outpatient COVID-19 infection. This data documents that non-ambulatory neuromuscular disease patients respond well to two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine despite low muscle mass and even chronic steroid use.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and accurate diagnostic tools that provide quantitative results at the point of care. Real-time RT-PCR requires large laboratories, a skilled workforce, complex and costly equipment, and labor-intensive sample processing. Despite tremendous efforts, scaling up RT-PCR tests is seemingly unattainable. To date, hundreds of millions of COVID-19 tests have been performed globally, but the demand for timely, accurate testing continues to outstrip supply. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing is emerging as an alternative to RT-PCR. However, the performance of these tests, namely their sensitivity, is still inadequate. To overcome the limitations of currently employed diagnostic tests, new tools that are both sensitive and scalable are urgently needed. We have developed a miniaturized electrochemical biosensor based on the integration of specific monoclonal antibodies with a biochip and a measurement platform, and applied it in the detection of Spike S1 protein, the binding protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, quantitative detection of sub-nanomolar concentrations of Spike S1 was demonstrated, exhibiting a broad detection range. To demonstrate the applicability of the biosensor, we have further developed a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus based on Spike protein-pseudo-typed VSV platform. Specific detection of different concentrations of pseudovirus particles was feasible in <30\\xa0min. This new tool may largely contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by enabling intensive testing to be performed and alleviating most of the hurdles that plague current diagnostics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the pandemic occurred due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there has always been a demand for a simple and sensitive diagnostic kit for detection of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In January 2020, WHO approved the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the presence of Covid-19 genetic material in individuals. Till date many diagnostic kits have arrived in the market for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In spite of being the gold standard method of Covid-19 detection, there are some drawbacks associated with RT-PCR which leads to false-negative results. Hence, in order to fulfil the need for an antibody testing kit for evaluating seroconversion and immunity acquisition in the population, an efficient, highly specific and sensitive assay, Chimera Soochak, an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) Kit has been developed. It works on the principle of detecting IgG antibodies developed specifically against the S1-RBD by employing a recombinant strain of S1-RBD produced in the HEK293 cell line. The developed kit was validated using different modes and methods to attain the utmost confidence on the samples collected from patients. The validation methodology included, validation with known samples, blind study, third-party validation, validation using WHO Reference Panel and comparison with FDA approved Surrogate virus neutralization kit. The kit was found successful in detecting IgG against the S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The kit had been validated on multiple parameters. A total of 900 samples had been tested by using this kit and it has exhibited the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for all the above-mentioned parameters.',\n",

Of note, COVID-19+ women deliver earlier than COVID-19- women, and the risk for severe neonatal and perinatal morbidity and mortality is significantly higher. The probability and pathways of vertical transmission of the virus from the pregnant woman to the fetus are highly controversial. Recent data have shown that 54 (13%) of 416 neonates born to COVID-19-positive women were infected. Here, we investigated term placentas collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and studied the main COVID-19 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, as well as NRP1. We performed qPCR and immunofluorescence on cryosections in combination with markers for syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, macrophages and stromal cells. The qPCR studies showed expression of both the truncated delta form of ACE2, which does not bind the COVID-19 spike protein, and the long form. The ACE2 antibody used does not distinguish between the two forms. We did not observe expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery on syncytio- and cytotrophoblast. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a subpopulation of stromal cells, which in part are CD68-positive macrophages. NRP1 is localized to endothelial cells. In sum, the term placenta is not an organ that directly favors vertical transmission of COVID-19, however, microtraumas and placentitis may weaken its barrier function.',\n",

That initiated a necessity for developing specific diagnostics and therapeutics along with vaccines to control such a pandemic. This endeavor describes generation of murine derived recombinant single-chain fragment variable (scFv) as a monoclonal antibody (MAb) platform targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A specific synthesized RBD coding sequence was cloned and expressed in Baculovirus expression system. The recombinant RBD (rRBD) was ascertained to be at the proper encoding size of ∼ 600bp and expressed protein of the molecular weight of ∼ 21KDa. Purified rRBD was proved genuinely antigenic and immunogenic, exhibiting specific reactivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and inducing strong seroconversion in immunized mice. The scFv phage display library against rRBD was successfully constructed, revealing ∼ 90 % recombination frequency, and great enriching factor reaching 88 % and 25 % in polyclonal Ab-based and MAb-based ELISAs, respectively. Typically, three unique scFvs were generated, selected, purified and molecularly identified. That was manifested by their: accurate structure, close relation to the mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, right anchored six complementarily-determining regions (CDRs) as three within variable heavy (vH) and variable light (vL) regions each, and proper configuration of the three-dimensional (3D) structure. Besides, their expression downstream in a non-suppressive amber codon of E. coli strain SS32 created a distinct protein band at an apparent molecular weight of ∼ 27KDa. Moreover, the purified scFvs showed authentic immunoreactivity and specificity to both rRBD and SARS-CoV-2 in western blot and ELISA. Accordingly, these developed scFvs platform might be a functional candidate for research, inexpensive diagnostics and therapeutics, mitigating spread of COVID-19.',\n",

In the contemporary scenario, point-of-care devices for mass testing and infection mapping within a population have proven themselves as of primordial importance. Here, we introduce a graphene-based Electrical-Electrochemical Vertical Device (EEVD) point-of-care biosensor, strategically engineered for serologic COVID-19 diagnosis. EEVD uses serologic IgG quantifications on SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) bioconjugate immobilized onto device surface. EEVD combines graphene basal plane with high charge carrier mobility, high conductivity, low intrinsic resistance, and interfacial sensitivity to capacitance alterations. EEVD application was carried out in real human serum samples. Since EEVD is a miniaturized device, it requires just 40\\xa0μL of sample for a point-of-care COVID-19 infections detection. When compared to serologic assays such ELISA and other immunochromatographic methods, EEVD presents some advantages such as time of analyses (15\\xa0min), sample preparation, and a LOD of 1.0\\xa0pg\\xa0mL',\n",

We have used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based prime-boost immunization strategy to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine candidate. We have constructed VSV genomes carrying exogenous genes resulting in the production of avirulent rVSV carrying the full-length spike protein (SF), the S1 subunit, or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) plus envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Adding the honeybee melittin signal peptide (msp) to the N-terminus enhanced the protein expression, and adding the VSV G protein transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (Gtc) enhanced protein incorporation into pseudotype VSV. All rVSVs expressed three different forms of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, but chimeras with VSV-Gtc demonstrated the highest rVSV-associated expression. In immunized mice, rVSV with chimeric S protein-Gtc derivatives induced the highest level of potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, and rVSV harboring the full-length msp-SF-Gtc proved to be the superior immunogen. More importantly, rVSV-msp-SF-Gtc vaccinated animals were completely protected from a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, we have developed an efficient strategy to induce a protective response in SARS-CoV-2 challenged immunized mice. Vaccination with our rVSV-based vector may be an effective solution in the global fight against COVID-19.',\n",

Two vaccine types were developed using two different technologies: viral vectors and mRNA. Thrombosis is one of the most severe and atypical adverse effects of vaccines. This study aimed to analyze published cases of thrombosis after COVID-19 vaccinations to identify patients' features, potential pathophysiological mechanisms, timing of appearance of the adverse events, and other critical issues.\\nWe performed a systematic electronic search of scientific articles regarding COVID-19 vaccine-related thrombosis and its complications on the PubMed (MEDLINE) database and through manual searches. We selected 10 out of 50 articles from February 1 to May 5, 2021 and performed a descriptive analysis of the adverse events caused by the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the adenovirus-based AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nIn the articles on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the sample consisted of three male patients with age heterogeneity. The time from vaccination to admission was ≤3 days in all cases; all patients presented signs of petechiae/purpura at admission, with a low platelet count. In the studies on the AstraZeneca vaccine, the sample consisted of 58 individuals with a high age heterogeneity and a high female prevalence. Symptoms appeared around the ninth day, and headache was the most common symptom. The platelet count was below the lower limit of the normal range. All patients except one were positive for PF4 antibodies. The cerebral venous sinus was the most affected site. Death was the most prevalent outcome in all studies, except for one study in which most of the patients remained alive.\\nVaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is an unknown nosological phenomenon secondary to inoculation with the COVID-19 vaccine. Several hypotheses have been formulated regarding its physiopathological mechanism. Recent studies have assumed a mechanism that is assimilable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with protagonist antibodies against the PF4-polyanion complex. Viral DNA has a negative charge and can bind to PF4, causing VITT. New experimental studies have assumed that thrombosis is related to a soluble adenoviral protein spike variant, originating from splicing events, which cause important endothelial inflammatory events, and binding to endothelial cells expressing ACE2.\\nFurther studies are needed to better identify VITT's pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic, demographic, or clinical predisposition of high-risk patients, to investigate the correlation of VITT with the different vaccine types, and to test the significance of the findings.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Macaques are a commonly used model for studying immunity to human viruses, including for studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. However, it is unknown whether macaque antibody responses recapitulate, and thus appropriately model, the response in humans. To answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach (Phage- DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in humans and macaques following either vaccination or infection. We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix- heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited. Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques.\\nNon-human primates, including macaques, are considered the best animal model for studying infectious diseases that infect humans. Vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 are first tested in macaques to assess immune responses prior to advancing to human trials, and macaques are also used to model the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there may be differences in how macaque and human antibodies recognize the SARS-CoV-2 entry protein, Spike. Here we characterized the locations on Spike that are recognized by antibodies from vaccinated or infected macaques and humans. We also made mutations to the viral sequence and assessed how these affected antibody binding, enabling a comparison of antibody binding requirements between macaques and humans at a very precise level. We found that macaques and humans share some responses, but also recognize distinct regions of Spike. We also found that in general, antibodies from different individuals had unique responses to viral mutations, regardless of species. These results will yield a better understanding of how macaque data can be used to inform human immunity to SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed, recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=30) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells in these individuals (n=52 distinct epitopes) are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC (n=50 mutations). Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC, and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time.\\nThe newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses, in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8+ T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron. These data suggest that the T-cell immune response in previously infected, and most likely vaccinated individuals, should still be effective against Omicron.',\n",

Initially, the virus was called \"novel CoV \" and then defined as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\" after more detailed investigations. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. The rapid spread of the disease in a few months has resulted in a global pandemic and it continues. However, there are no specific effective anti-viral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infection, some antiviral drugs are using in the therapy of COVID-19 with limited success. Currently, for the prevention of the pandemic, global vaccination seems to be important. Antiviral protection of vaccines is provided by the development of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Antibody response develops against spike protein and nucleocapsid protein but neutralizing antibodies are formed against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. It has also been shown that most viral proteins are recognized in T-cell responses. Vaccine discovery trials for COVID-19 have begun all over the world since the outbreak began. More than 100 vaccine studies against COVID-19 have been published in the last year. Some of them were urgently approved and used worldwide. The current study aimed to review the progression and current use of COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"One of the proven methods to prevent and inhibit viral infections is to use antibodies to block the initial Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and avoid its binding with the host cells. Thus, developing these RBD-targeting antibodies would be a promising approach for treating the SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease and stop virus replication. Macrocyclic epitopes constitute closer mimics of the receptor's actual topology and, as such, are expected to be superior epitopes for antibody generation. This work demonstrated the vital effect of the three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the developed antibodies' activity against RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater stability of the cyclic epitopes in comparison with the linear counterpart, which was reflected in the activity of their produced antibodies. Indeed, the antibodies we developed using macrocyclic epitopes showed superiority with respect to binding to RBD proteins compared to antibodies formed from a linear peptide. The results of the present work constitute a roadmap for developing superior antibodies that could be used to inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 and prevent its reproduction.\",\n",

Our design is centered on an immunogen generated by fusing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the conserved stalk of H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA). Remarkably, the constructed vaccine effectively induced both SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibodies and anti-influenza antibodies in mice, consequently affording protection from lethal SARS-CoV-2 and H7N9 challenges and effective H3N2 control.

       "  'abstract': 'The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike protein (S) has been verified to be the main target for potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in most coronaviruses, and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of some betacoronaviruses has also been indicated to induce nAbs. For alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E, its RBD has been shown to have neutralizing epitopes, and these epitopes could change over time. However, whether neutralizing epitopes exist on the NTD and whether these epitopes change like those of the RBD are still unknown. Here, we verified that neutralizing epitopes exist on the NTD of HCoV-229E. Furthermore, we characterized an NTD targeting nAb 5H10, which could neutralize both pseudotyped and authentic HCoV-229E VR740 in vitro. Epitope mapping indicated that 5H10 targeted motif E1 (147-167 aa) and identified F159 as critical for 5H10 binding. More importantly, our results revealed that motif E1 was highly conserved among clinical isolates except for F159. Further data proved that mutations at position 159 gradually appeared over time and could completely abolish the neutralizing ability of 5H10, supporting the notion that position 159 may be under selective pressure during the human epidemic. In addition, we also found that contemporary clinical serum has a stronger binding capacity for the NTD of contemporary strains than historic strains, proving that the epitope on the NTD could change over time. In summary, these findings define a novel neutralizing epitope on the NTD of HCoV-229E S and provide a theoretical basis for the design of vaccines against HCoV-229E or related coronaviruses. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Novel strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) harboring nucleotide changes (mutations) in the spike gene have emerged and are spreading rapidly. These mutations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, virulence, or resistance to some neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the accurate detection of spike mutants is crucial for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and identifying neutralizing antibody-resistance caused by amino acid changes in the receptor-binding domain. Here, we developed five SARS-CoV-2 spike gene primer pairs (5-SSG primer assay; 69S, 144S, 417S, 484S, and 570S) and verified their ability to detect nine key spike mutations (ΔH69/V70, T95I, G142D, ΔY144, K417T/N, L452R, E484K/Q, N501Y, and H655Y) using a Sanger sequencing-based assay. The 5-SSG primer assay showed 100% specificity and a conservative limit of detection with a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) values of 1.4 × 102 TCID50/mL. The accuracy of the 5-SSG primer assay was confirmed by next generation sequencing. The results of these two approaches showed 100% consistency. Taken together, the ability of the 5-SSG primer assay to accurately detect key SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants is reliable. Thus, it is a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike gene mutants in a clinical setting, thereby helping to improve the management of patients with COVID-19.',\n",

Compared with the last VOC (Delta variant), more mutations were identified, which may address the characteristics of Omicron. Considering these crucial mutations and their implications including an increase in transmissibility, COVID-19 severity, and reduction of efficacy of currently available diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, Omicron has been classified as one of the VOC. Notably, 15 of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein, which may alter transmissibility, infectivity, neutralizing antibody escape, and vaccine breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Therefore, our present study characterizes the mutational hotspots of the Omicron variant in comparison with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed information was analyzed to characterize the global perspective of Omicron, including transmission dynamic, effect on testing, and immunity, which shall promote the progress of the clinical application and basic research. Collectively, our data suggest that due to continuous variation in the spike glycoprotein sequences, the use of coronavirus-specific attachment inhibitors may not be the current choice of therapy for emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Hence, we need to proceed with a sense of urgency in this matter.',\n",

Two loop-like epitopes with lengths of 22 and 42 amino acid residues were selected from the receptor-binding motif of the Spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that participate in a large number of protein-protein interactions in the complexes with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies. Two types of hybrid proteins, including one of the two selected epitopes, were constructed. To fix conformation of the selected epitopes, an approach using protein scaffolds was used. The homologue of Rop protein from the Escherichia coli ColE1 plasmid containing helix-turn-helix motif was used as an epitope scaffold for the convergence of C- and N-termini of the loop-like epitopes. Loop epitopes were inserted into the turn region. The conformation was additionally fixed by a disulfide bond formed between the cysteine residues present within the epitopes. For the purpose of multimerization, either aldolase from Thermotoga maritima, which forms a trimer in solution, or alpha-helical trimerizer of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, was attached to the epitopes incorporated into the Rop-like protein. To enable purification on the heparin-containing sorbents, a short fragment from the heparin-binding hemagglutinin of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was inserted at the C-terminus of the hybrid proteins. All the obtained proteins demonstrated high level of immunogenicity after triplicate parenteral administration to mice.

We report the results of a sequential evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in convalescent patients with a median follow-up of 14 months (range 12.4-15.4) post first symptom onset. We report persistence of antibodies for all four specificities tested [Spike, Spike Receptor Binding Domain (Spike-RBD), Nucleocapsid, Nucleocapsid RNA Binding Domain (N-RBD)]. Anti-Spike antibodies persist better than anti-Nucleocapsid antibodies. The durability analysis supports a bi-phasic antibody decay with longer half-lives of antibodies after 6 months and antibody persistence for up to 14 months. Patients infected with the Wuhan (WA1) strain maintained strong cross-reactive recognition of Alpha and Delta Spike-RBD but significantly reduced binding to Beta and Mu Spike-RBD. Sixty percent of convalescent patients with detectable WA1-specific NAb also showed strong neutralization of the Delta variant, the prevalent strain of the present pandemic. These data show that convalescent patients maintain functional antibody responses for more than one year after infection, suggesting a strong long-lasting response after symptomatic disease that may offer a prolonged protection against re-infection. One patient from this cohort showed strong increase of both Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies at 14 months post-infection indicating SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. These antibodies showed stronger cross-reactivity to a panel of Spike-RBD including Beta, Delta and Mu and neutralization of a panel of Spike variants including Beta and Gamma. This patient provides an example of strong anti-Spike recall immunity able to control infection at an asymptomatic level. Together, the antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients persist over 14 months and continue to maintain cross-reactivity to the current variants of concern and show strong functional properties.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Identifying the epitope of an antibody is a key step in understanding its function and its potential as a therapeutic. Sequence-based clonal clustering can identify antibodies with similar epitope complementarity, however, antibodies from markedly different lineages but with similar structures can engage the same epitope. We describe a novel computational method for epitope profiling based on structural modelling and clustering. Using the method, we demonstrate that sequence dissimilar but functionally similar antibodies can be found across the Coronavirus Antibody Database, with high accuracy (92% of antibodies in multiple-occupancy structural clusters bind to consistent domains). Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than is suggested by sequence-based approaches. Our results show that applying structural analytics to large class-specific antibody databases will enable high confidence structure-function relationships to be drawn, yielding new opportunities to identify functional convergence hitherto missed by sequence-only analysis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The evolution of circulating viruses is shaped by their need to evade antibody response, which mainly targets the viral spike. Because of the high density of spikes on the viral surface, not all antigenic sites are targeted equally by antibodies. We offer here a geometry-based approach to predict and rank the probability of surface residues of SARS spike (S protein) and influenza H1N1 spike (hemagglutinin) to acquire antibody-escaping mutations utilizing in-silico models of viral structure. We used coarse-grained MD simulations to estimate the on-rate (targeting) of an antibody model to surface residues of the spike protein. Analyzing publicly available sequences, we found that spike surface sequence diversity of the pre-pandemic seasonal influenza H1N1 and the sarbecovirus subgenus highly correlates with our model prediction of antibody targeting. In particular, we identified an antibody-targeting gradient, which matches a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike. This identifies the role of viral surface geometry in shaping the evolution of circulating viruses. For the 2009 H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike was not observed. Our model further allowed us to identify key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike at which antibody escape mutations have now occurred. Therefore, it can inform of the likely functional role of observed mutations and predict at which residues antibody-escaping mutation might arise.',\n",

Moreover, the impact of these variants on infectivity and response to neutralizing antibodies has been assessed. In the present study, we retrieved a total number of 176 complete and high-quality S glycoprotein sequences of Iranian SARS-COV-2 in public database of the GISAID and GenBank from April 2020 up to May 2021. Then, we identified the number of variables, singleton and parsimony informative sites at both gene and protein levels and discussed the possible functional consequences of important mutations on the infectivity and response to neutralizing antibodies. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to represent the relationship between Iranian SARS-COV2 and variants of concern (VOC), variants of interest (VOI) and reference sequence. We found that the four current VOCs - Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta - are circulated in different regions in Iran. The Delta variant is notably more transmissible than other variants, and is expected to become a dominant variant. However, some of the Delta variants in Iran carry an additional mutation, namely E1202Q in the HR2 subdomain that might confer an advantage to viral/cell membrane fusion process. We also observed some more common mutations such as an N-terminal domain (NTD) deletion at position I210 and P863H in fusion peptide-heptad repeat 1 span region in Iranian SARS-COV-2.

We conducted a fourth nationwide serosurvey to estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population aged ≥6 years and healthcare workers (HCWs).\\nWe did a cross-sectional study between 14 June and 6 July 2021 in the same 70 districts across 20 states and 1 union territory where 3 previous rounds of serosurveys were conducted. From each district, 10 clusters (villages in rural areas and wards in urban areas) were selected by the probability proportional to population size method. From each district, a minimum of 400 individuals aged ≥6 years from the general population (40 individuals from each cluster) and 100 HCWs from the district public health facilities were included. The serum samples were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against S1-RBD and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 using chemiluminescence immunoassay. We estimated the weighted and test-adjusted seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, along with 95% CIs, based on the presence of antibodies to S1-RBD and/or nucleocapsid protein. Of the 28,975 individuals who participated in the survey, 2,892 (10%) were aged 6-9 years, 5,798 (20%) were aged 10-17 years, and 20,285 (70%) were aged ≥18 years; 15,160 (52.3%) participants were female, and 21,794 (75.2%) resided in rural areas. The weighted and test-adjusted prevalence of IgG antibodies against S1-RBD and/or nucleocapsid protein among the general population aged ≥6 years was 67.6% (95% CI 66.4% to 68.7%). Seroprevalence increased with age (p < 0.001) and was not different in rural and urban areas (p = 0.822). Compared to unvaccinated adults (62.3%, 95% CI 60.9% to 63.7%), seroprevalence was significantly higher among individuals who had received 1 vaccine dose (81.0%, 95% CI 79.6% to 82.3%, p < 0.001) and 2 vaccine doses (89.8%, 95% CI 88.4% to 91.1%, p < 0.001). The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies among 7,252 HCWs was 85.2% (95% CI 83.5% to 86.7%). Important limitations of the study include the survey design, which was aimed to estimate seroprevalence at the national level and not at a sub-national level, and the non-participation of 19% of eligible individuals in the survey.\\nNearly two-thirds of individuals aged ≥6 years from the general population and 85% of HCWs had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by June-July 2021 in India.

       "  'abstract': 'The prevalence of migraine is highest among working age individuals, and this disease is associated with an increased number of sick leaves and health care visits, as well as lost productivity. Erenumab, the first monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway, is effective in decreasing the monthly number of migraine days, but evidence of its impact on the number of sick leave days and health care visits in patients with migraine is limited.\\nThis retrospective registry study focused on occupationally active patients with migraine treated with erenumab at a Finnish private health care provider, Terveystalo. Erenumab responders, defined as patients who had at least two unique prescriptions of erenumab and no prescription of other CGRP inhibitor\\xa0(CGRPi), were followed for 12\\xa0months prior to and after erenumab treatment initiation (index), and the change in the number of headache-related and all-cause sick leave days, health care visits and prescriptions for other medications during this period were assessed from the registry data. The same outcomes were assessed in an age- and sex-matched control group of migraine patients not receiving CGRPi to control for potential changes in patient behavior and health care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nAltogether, 162 patients who were entitled to employer-sponsored health care received erenumab and met the 12-month follow-up requirements. In the responder group (n\\u2009=\\u200982; 50.1%) headache-related sick leave days were reduced by 73.9% (p\\u2009=\\u20090.035) and health care visits by 44.6% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) in the 12\\xa0months following treatment initiation compared to the period of 12\\xa0months prior to treatment. All-cause sick leave days were reduced by 19.4% and all-cause health care visits by 13.5%, but these changes were not statistically significant. Triptan prescriptions decreased by 30.4% (p\\u2009=\\u20090.012) and other prophylactic treatments by 31.5% (p\\u2009=\\u20090.004). No significant changes were observed in the corresponding outcomes in the migraine control group during the same period.\\nThe results of this registry study suggest that in addition to the effect on the monthly number of migraine days documented in clinical trials, erenumab can significantly reduce the number of headache-related sick leave days and health care visits in employed patients with migraine managed in routine clinical practice.',\n",

These variants have raised concerns whether pre-existing immunity to vaccination or prior infection would be able to protect against the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or not. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-confirmed patients in the beginning of the first (April/May 2020) and second (April/May 2021) waves of COVID-19 in India (Hisar, Haryana). Upon complete nucleotide sequencing, the viruses were found to be genetically related with wild-type (WT) and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 produced a rapid cytopathic effect (24-36 h as compared to 48-72 h in WT) and had bigger plaque size but a shorter life cycle (~6 h as compared to the ~8 h in WT). Furthermore, the Delta variant achieved peak viral titers within 24 h as compared to the 48 h in WT. These evidence suggested that the Delta variant replicates significantly faster than the WT SARS-CoV-2. The virus neutralization experiments indicated that antibodies elicited by vaccination are more efficacious in neutralizing the WT virus but significantly less potent against the Delta variant. Our findings have implications in devising suitable vaccination, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, besides providing insights into understanding virus replication and transmission.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain of coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is the most challenging pandemic of this century. The growing COVID-19 pandemic has triggered extraordinary efforts to restrict the virus in numerous ways, owing to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Immunotherapy, which includes artificially stimulating the immune system to generate an immunological response, is regarded as an effective strategy for preventing and treating several infectious illnesses and malignancies. Given the pandemic's high fatality rate and quick expansion, an effective vaccination is urgently needed to keep it under control. The basic goal of all COVID-19 vaccine programs is to develop a vaccine that causes the generation of surface protein neutralizing antibodies in subjects. The epitope discovery for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates is likewise made using an immuno-informatics methodology. It can be used to find the epitopes in viral proteins important for cytotoxic T cells and B cells. A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine that can elicit the necessary immune response is necessary to end the epidemic. The global search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is yielding results. More than a dozen vaccines have already been approved around the world, with many more in the clinical trials. Patents can cover the underlying technology used to generate a vaccine, whereas trade secrets can cover manufacturing methods and procedures.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which constitute about 5-10% of CD4+T cells expressing Foxp3 transcription factor and CD25(IL-2 receptor α chain), are key regulators in controlling immunological self-tolerance and various immune responses. However, how Treg cells control antigen-specific immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of transient breakdown of the immunological tolerance induced by Treg-cell depletion on adaptive immune responses against administered SARS-CoV-2 antigen, spike protein 1 (S1). Notably, without the use of adjuvants, transient Treg-cell depletion in mice induced anti-S1 antibodies that neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2, follicular helper T cell formation and S1-binding germinal center B cell responses, but prevented the onset of developing autoimmune diseases. To further clarify the mechanisms, we investigated maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which is essential to initiate antigen-specific immunity. We found that the transient Treg-cell depletion resulted in maturation of both migratory and resident DCs in draining lymph nodes that captured S1-antigen. Moreover, we observed S1-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells with interferon-γ production. Thus, captured S1 was successfully presented by DCs, including cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. These data indicate that transient Treg-cell depletion in the absence of adjuvants induces maturation of antigen-presenting DCs and succeeds in generating antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Finally, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific immune responses induced by transient Treg-cell depletion in the absence of adjuvants were compatible with those induced with an effective adjuvant, polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidyl acid (poly IC) and that the combination of transient Treg-cell depletion with poly IC induced potent responses. These findings highlight the capacity for manipulating Treg cells to induce protective adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with activating antigen-presenting DCs, which may improve the efficacy of ongoing vaccine therapies and help enhance responses to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A comprehensive study of the B cell response against SARS-CoV-2 could be significant for understanding the immune response and developing therapeutical antibodies and vaccines. To define the dynamics and characteristics of the antibody repertoire following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the mRNA transcripts of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) repertoires of 24 peripheral blood samples collected between 3 and 111 days after symptom onset from 10 COVID-19 patients. Massive clonal expansion of naïve B cells with limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) was observed in the second week after symptom onset. The proportion of low-SHM IgG clones strongly correlated with spike-specific IgG antibody titers, highlighting the significant activation of naïve B cells in response to a novel virus infection. The antibody isotype switching landscape showed a transient IgA surge in the first week after symptom onset, followed by a sustained IgG elevation that lasted for at least 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited poly-germline reactive antibody responses. Interestingly, 17 different IGHV germline genes recombined with IGHJ6 showed significant clonal expansion. By comparing the IgH repertoires that we sequenced with the 774 reported SARS-CoV-2-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 13 shared spike-specific IgH clusters were found. These shared spike-specific IgH clusters are derived from the same lineage of several recently published neutralizing mAbs, including CC12.1, CC12.3, C102, REGN10977, and 4A8. Furthermore, identical spike-specific IgH sequences were found in different COVID-19 patients, suggesting a highly convergent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis based on sequencing antibody repertoires from different individuals revealed key signatures of the systemic B cell response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. ',\n",

A low Cpass binding inhibition was observed in the first collection in 11 seronegative cases, with high titers among those anti-S1 positive. All children showed an important increase in antibody titers on day 30. The event allowed the documentation of a robust serological response to one dose of CoronaVac in this small population of young children, with no major adverse effects.

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. Here, we demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain, which occurred in co-mutations Y449S and N501Y, has reduced infectivity compared to that of the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracking the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in more than 2.2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations, like those in Omicron, will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is either vaccinated or infected.

       "  'abstract': 'As vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are now being rolled out, a better understanding of immunity to the virus, whether from infection, or passive or active immunisation, and the durability of this protection is required. This will benefit from the ability to measure antibody-based protection to SARS-CoV-2, ideally with rapid turnaround and without the need for laboratory-based testing.\\nWe have developed a lateral flow POC test that can measure levels of RBD-ACE2 neutralising antibody (NAb) from whole blood, with a result that can be determined by eye or quantitatively on a small instrument. We compared our lateral flow test with the gold-standard microneutralisation assay, using samples from convalescent and vaccinated donors, as well as immunised macaques.\\nWe show a high correlation between our lateral flow test with conventional neutralisation and that this test is applicable with animal samples. We also show that this assay is readily adaptable to test for protection to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the beta variant which revealed a marked reduction in NAb activity. Lastly, using a cohort of vaccinated humans, we demonstrate that our whole-blood test correlates closely with microneutralisation assay data (specificity 100% and sensitivity 96% at a microneutralisation cutoff of 1:40) and that fingerprick whole blood samples are sufficient for this test.\\nTaken together, the COVID-19 NAb-test\\nSupport was received from the Victorian Operational Infrastructure Support Program and the Australian Government Department of Health.

Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are thought to be a primary immune defense against the virus. Large, diverse, well-characterized cohorts of convalescent individuals provide standardized values to benchmark nAb responses to past SARS-CoV-2 infection and define potentially protective levels of immunity.\\nThis analysis comprises an observational cohort of 329 HIV-seronegative adults in the United States (n = 167) and Peru (n = 162) convalescing from SARS-CoV-2 infection from May through October 2020. The mean age was 48 years (range 18 to 86), 54% of the cohort overall was Hispanic, and 34% identified as White. nAb titers were measured in serum by SARS-CoV-2.D614G Spike-pseudotyped virus infection of 293T/ACE2 cells. Multiple linear regression was applied to define associations between nAb titers and demographic variables, disease severity and time from infection or disease onset, and comorbidities within and across US and Peruvian cohorts over time. nAb titers peaked 28 to 42 days post-diagnosis and were higher in participants with a history of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (p < 0.001). Diabetes, age >55 years, male sex assigned at birth, and, in some cases, body mass index were also independently associated with higher nAb titers, whereas hypertension was independently associated with lower nAb titers. nAb titers did not differ by race, underlying pulmonary disease or smoking. Two months post-enrollment, nAb ID50 (ID80) titers declined 3.5 (2.8)-fold overall. Study limitations in this observational, convalescent cohort include survivorship bias and missing early viral loads and acute immune responses to correlate with the convalescent responses we observed.\\nIn summary, in our cohort, nAb titers after SARS-CoV-2 infection peaked approximately 1 month post-diagnosis and varied by age, sex assigned at birth, disease severity, and underlying comorbidities. Our data show great heterogeneity in nAb responses among people with recent COVID-19, highlighting the challenges of interpreting natural history studies and gauging responses to vaccines and therapeutics among people with recent infection. Our observations illuminate potential correlations of demographic and clinical characteristics with nAb responses, a key element for protection from COVID-19, thus informing development and implementation of preventative and therapeutic strategies globally.\\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04403880.',\n",

Importantly, particular subgroups are more prone to severe disease, namely patients with poor immune responses. This includes cancer patients with solid and haematological disease, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients and those with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. Outcomes for patients with poor immune responses receiving antibody therapy for underlying disease and SARS-CoV-2 severe infection are undergoing investigation. The objective of this study was to perform a search on patients with poor immune responses with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, to assess if antibody therapy is beneficial in such populations. We performed searches using PubMED and medrXiv up to May 2021 of patients with solid and hematologic malignancy, SOT patients and acquired or congenital immunodeficiency. The primary outcome was to assess if antibody therapy was included during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes of such treatment in this population. Here we find that there is a repurposing of monoclonal antibodies to target cytokine release syndrome, along with the use of convalescent plasma (CP). Despite CP demonstrating promising results, we reiterate evidence that CP forces mutational escape and subsequent variant development. Repurposing of antibody therapies (such as Tocilizumab) proved effective, especially in SOT patients. This also potentially opens an avenue for the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; however, studies have yet to focus on patients with poor immune responses as a subpopulation.',\n",

SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) plays fundamental roles related to cell infection. Antibodies could be developed to target RBD and represent a potential approach for the neutralization of the virus. Epitopes used to produce antibodies are generally linear peptides and thus possess multiple confirmations that do not reflect the actual topology of the targeted part in the native protein. On the other hand, macrocyclic epitopes could constitute closer mimics of the native protein topology and, as such, could generate superior antibodies. In this study, we demonstrated the vital effect of the size and the three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the activity of the developed antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater stability of the cyclic epitopes compared with the linear counterparts, which was reflected in the affinity of the produced antibodies. The antibodies developed using macrocyclic epitopes showed superiority with respect to binding to RBD compared to antibodies formed from linear peptides.

Relatively high vaccination rates have been achieved in most regions of the United States and several countries worldwide. However, access to vaccines in low- and mid-income countries (LMICs) is still suboptimal. Second generation vaccines that are universally affordable and induce systemic and mucosal immunity are needed. Here we performed an extended safety and immunogenicity analysis of a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine consisting of a live Newcastle disease virus vector expressing a pre-fusion stabilized version of the spike protein (NDV-HXP-S) administered intranasally (IN), intramuscularly (IM), or IN followed by IM in Sprague Dawley rats. Local reactogenicity, systemic toxicity, and post-mortem histopathology were assessed after the vaccine administration, with no indication of severe local or systemic reactions. Immunogenicity studies showed that the three vaccination regimens tested elicited high antibody titers against the wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the NDV vector. Moreover, high antibody titers were induced against the spike of B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of concern (VOCs). Importantly, robust levels of serum antibodies with neutralizing activity against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate were detected after the boost. Overall, our study expands the pre-clinical safety and immunogenicity characterization of NDV-HXP-S and reinforces previous findings in other animal models about its high immunogenicity.

In contrast, heterologous polyclonal antibodies raised against S protein, through the recognition of multiple target epitopes, have the potential to maintain neutralization capacities. XAV-19 is a swine glyco-humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibody raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. XAV-19 target epitopes were found distributed all over the RBD and particularly cover the receptor binding motives (RBMs), in direct contact sites with the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Therefore, in Spike/ACE-2 interaction assays, XAV-19 showed potent neutralization capacities of the original Wuhan Spike and of the United Kingdom (Alpha/B.1.1.7) and South African (Beta/B.1.351) variants. These results were confirmed by cytopathogenic assays using Vero E6 and live virus variants including the Brazil (Gamma/P.1) and the Indian (Delta/B.1.617.2) variants. In a selective pressure study on Vero E6 cells conducted over 1 month, no mutation was associated with the addition of increasing doses of XAV-19. The potential to reduce viral load in lungs was confirmed in a human ACE-2 transduced mouse model. XAV-19 is currently evaluated in patients hospitalized for COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia in phase 2a-2b (NCT04453384) where safety was already demonstrated and in an ongoing 2/3 trial (NCT04928430) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XAV-19 in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

       "  'abstract': \"Infection of human cells by pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, typically proceeds by cell surface binding to a crucial receptor. The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), yet new studies reveal the importance of additional extracellular co-receptors that mediate binding and host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types, where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens' cellular uptake. Biophysical and cell infection studies are done to determine whether vimentin might bind SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate its uptake. Dynamic light scattering shows that vimentin binds to pseudovirus coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and antibodies against vimentin block in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-expressing cells. The results are consistent with a model in which extracellular vimentin acts as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a binding affinity less than that of the spike protein with ACE2. Extracellular vimentin may thus serve as a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex in mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and vimentin-targeting agents may yield new therapeutic strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 infection.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Numerous vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, are under development. The majority of vaccine candidates to date are designed to induce immune responses against the viral spike (S) protein, although different forms of S antigen have been incorporated. To evaluate the yield and immunogenicity of different forms of S, we constructed modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing full-length S (MVA-S), the RBD, and soluble S ectodomain and tested their immunogenicity in dose-ranging studies in mice. All three MVA vectors induced spike-specific immunoglobulin G after one subcutaneous immunization and serum titers were boosted following a second immunization. The MVA-S and MVA-ssM elicited the strongest neutralizing antibody responses. In assessing protective efficacy, MVA-S-immunized adult Syrian hamsters were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (USA/WA1/2020). MVA-S-vaccinated hamsters exhibited less severe manifestations of atypical pneumocyte hyperplasia, hemorrhage, vasculitis, and especially consolidation, compared to control animals. They also displayed significant reductions in gross pathology scores and weight loss, and a moderate reduction in virus shedding was observed post challenge in nasal washes. There was evidence of reduced viral replication by in situ hybridization, although the reduction in viral RNA levels in lungs and nasal turbinates did not reach significance. Taken together, the data indicate that immunization with two doses of an MVA vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S provides protection against a stringent SARS-CoV-2 challenge of adult Syrian hamsters, reaffirm the utility of this animal model for evaluating candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and demonstrate the value of an MVA platform in facilitating vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

We also show a range of neutralizing activity (0-45%) with median inhibition ranging from 17.6 % to 23.3 % in serum that interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike attachment to ACE2 independently of age group. While the abundance of sCoV antibodies did not directly correlate with neutralization, we show that neutralizing activity is rather dependent on relative ratios of IgGs in sera directed to all four sCoV spike proteins.

Here, we describe the neutralizing capacities of antibodies secreted by volunteers in the Chilean population immunized with CoronaVac against variants of concern Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.617.2).\\nVolunteers enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial were vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac in 0-14 or 0-28 immunization schedules. Sera samples were used to evaluate the capacity of antibodies induced by the vaccine to block the binding between Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from variants of concern and the human ACE2 receptor by an in-house ELISA. Further, conventional microneutralization assays were used to test neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, interferon-γ-secreting T cells against Spike from variants of concern were evaluated in PBMCs from vaccinated subjects using ELISPOT.\\nCoronaVac promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block the RBD of all the SARS-CoV-2 variants studied. Seropositivity rates of neutralizing antibodies in the population evaluated were over 97% for the lineage B strain, over 80% for Alpha and Gamma variants, over 75% for Delta variant and over 60% for the Beta variant. Geometric means titers of blocking antibodies were reduced when tested against SARS-CoV-2 variants as compared to ancestral strain. We also observed that antibodies from vaccinated subjects were able to neutralize the infection of variants D614G, Alpha, Gamma and Delta in a conventional microneutralization assay. Importantly, after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed that the blocking capacity of antibodies from vaccinated volunteers increased up to ten times for all the variants tested. We compared the number of interferon-γ-secreting T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 Spike WT and variants of concern from vaccinated subjects and we did not detect significant differences.\\nImmunization with CoronaVac in either immunization schedule promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and partially neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it stimulates cellular responses against all variants of concern.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged around December 2019 claimed millions of lives. For vaccine development, S protein on viral envelope that binds to ACE2 receptor on cells for entry was identified as vaccine candidate. S protein consists of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in the S1 subunit followed by the S2 subunit with an intermediate furin cleavage site. A stabilized version of S protein with 2 proline residues was used as antigen. Overall, most vaccines exhibited efficacy between 80 and 95%. However, being a RNA virus that is prone to mutations along with selection pressure on S protein and frequent use of convalescent plasma led to evolution of variants. These variants are responsible for multiple waves of infection observed globally. In our review, we discuss current data on vaccines and its efficacy in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan and its variants. Further, our docked mutations observed in variants on the ACE2-S complex cryo-EM structure show that mostly the S1 domain is under selection pressure where major mutations occur in the N terminal domain (NTD), RBM and junction near S1-S2 subunit. Therefore, this review would be a reference for development of new candidate antigen(s) with better efficacy against variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2, the protein that enables the virus to infect human cells, is the basis for many vaccines and a hotspot of concerning virus evolution. Here, we discuss the outstanding progress in structural characterization of the S-protein and how these structures facilitate analysis of virus function and evolution. We emphasize the differences in reported structures and that analysis of structure-function relationships is sensitive to the structure used. We show that the average residue solvent exposure in nearly complete structures is a good descriptor of open vs closed conformation states. Because of structural heterogeneity of functionally important surface-exposed residues, we recommend using averages of a group of high-quality protein structures rather than a single structure before reaching conclusions on specific structure-function relationships. To illustrate these points, we analyze some significant chemical tendencies of prominent S-protein mutations in the context of the available structures. In the discussion of new variants, we emphasize the selectivity of binding to ACE2 vs prominent antibodies rather than simply the antibody escape or ACE2 affinity separately. We note that larger chemical changes, in particular increased electrostatic charge or side-chain volume of exposed surface residues, are recurring in mutations of concern, plausibly related to adaptation to the negative surface potential of human ACE2. We also find indications that the fixated mutations of the S-protein in the main variants are less destabilizing than would be expected on average, possibly pointing toward a selection pressure on the S-protein. The richness of available structures for all of these situations provides an enormously valuable basis for future research into these structure-function relationships.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vaccines are proving to be highly effective in controlling hospitalisation and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection but the emergence of viral variants with novel antigenic profiles threatens to diminish their efficacy. Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here, we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals, the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351 (South African) variant (6.29-fold reduction) that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2, conferred reductions in titre of 7.77, 11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses, the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69, 4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs, and others, demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly, booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The appearance of variants of mutated virus in course of the Covid-19 pandemic raises concerns regarding the risk of possible formation of variants that can evade the protective immune response elicited by the single antigen S-protein gene-based vaccines. This risk may be avoided by inclusion of several antigens in vaccines, so that a variant that evades the immune response to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus will be destroyed by the protective immune response against other viral antigens. A simple way for preparing multi-antigenic enveloped-virus vaccines is using the inactivated whole-virus as vaccine. However, immunogenicity of such vaccines may be suboptimal because of poor uptake of the vaccine by antigen-presenting-cells (APC) due to electrostatic repulsion by the negative charges of sialic-acid on both the glycan-shield of the vaccinating virus and on the carbohydrate-chains (glycans) of APC. In addition, glycan-shield can mask many antigenic peptides. These effects of the glycan-shield can be reduced and immunogenicity of the vaccinating virus markedly increased by glycoengineering viral glycans for replacing sialic-acid units on glycans with α-gal epitopes (Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R).

       "  'abstract': 'The appearance of multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants during the COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of grave concern. Some of these variants, such as B.1.617.2, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351, manifest higher infectivity and virulence than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, with potential dramatic effects on the course of the pandemic. So far, analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast, insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the Spike (S) protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Here, we identify 346 unique inserts of different lengths in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing artifacts. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. At least three inserts in the N-terminal domain of the S protein are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies, whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity. Thus, inserts in the S protein can affect its antigenic properties and merit monitoring.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The high transmission and mortality rates associated with SARS-CoV-2 have led to tragic consequences worldwide. Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome since its identification in late 2019 has identified many sequence changes and the emergence of novel strains, each described by co-segregation of a particular set of sequence variations. Variants designated G, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), and delta (B.1.617.2) are important lineages that emerged sequentially and are considered variants of concern. A notable feature of the last four, each of which ultimately evolved from clade G, is the large number (≥ 20) of co-segregating sequence variations associated with them. Several variations are in the spike gene, and some variations are shared among or between strains. Meanwhile, observation of recurrent infections with the same or different SARS-CoV-2 lineages has raised concerns about the duration of the immune responses induced by the initial infection or the vaccine that was administered. While the alpha strain is sensitive to immune responses induced by earlier strains, the beta, gamma, and delta strains can escape antibody neutralization. Apart from random replication errors, intra-host RNA editing, chronic infections, and recombination are processes that may promote the accumulation of sequence changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The known contribution of recombination to coronavirus evolution and recent data pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that recombination may be particularly important. Continued surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is imperative.',\n",

We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1831 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-associated TCRs that have strong evidence of restriction to patients with a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 59.7% (1093/1831) were more abundant among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.01), demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development.

In addition, we investigated whether the antibody response to each vaccine differed according to sex and age.\\nHealthcare workers (HCWs) at a general hospital who were vaccinated with two doses of either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 were invited to participate in this prospective cohort study. Blood samples of HCWs vaccinated with both ChAdOx1 doses over a period of 12 weeks were collected at weeks 4 and 8 post first vaccination and 2 weeks post second vaccination. Blood samples of HCWs vaccinated with BNT162b2 were collected in the third week after the first dose, and the second dose was then administered on the same day; two weeks post second dose (5 weeks after the first dose), blood samples were collected to assess the antibody response. The titers of anti-S antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain and the neutralizing antibodies in the collected blood were evaluated.\\nOf the 309 HCWs enrolled in the study, 205 received ChAdOx1 and 104 received BNT162b2.

Our experiments reveal that antibodies targeting the S-trimer typically prefer stoichiometries lower than the symmetry-predicted 3:1 binding. We determine that this behavior arises from the interplay of steric clashes and avidity effects that are not reflected in common antibody constructs (i.e., Fabs). Surprisingly, these substoichiometric complexes are fully effective at blocking ACE2 binding despite containing free receptor binding sites.

The cohort was selected because of its high proportion of individuals who had lost neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), thus allowing us to specifically investigate the reserve immunity from SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs in this setting. Class-switched spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) tetramer-binding MBCs persisted 5 months after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of age.

       "  'abstract': 'Patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency (PID or SID) face increased insecurity and discomfort in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, not knowing if and to what extent their comorbidities may impact the course of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients in this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG). Whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated (e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency) remains a pressing question for this patient population.\\nWe investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until June 2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from May 2020 to August 2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present.\\nFinal containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 single plasma donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations.\\nCP donations presented with high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were not/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 600\\xa0IU/mL. IVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities for SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021 entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 21\\xa0IU/mL in December 2020 to 506\\xa0IU/mL in June 2021 with a maximum of 864\\xa0IU/mL for the most recent lots. Pharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published pharmacokinetic investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16\\xa0IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from May 2021 of 216\\xa0IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64\\xa0IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in June 2021.\\nSARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until Fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products, implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients.\\nPeople with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens such as bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins [Ig]) are prepared from plasma, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells, of healthy donors. This plasma is then split up during pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864\\xa0IU/mL. Considering that the US represents Octapharma’s main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG) neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially reach a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection.',\n",

Development and validation were performed under regulatory guidelines, and the test obtained emergency use authorization (EUA) from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Mount Sinai coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody assay is an orthogonal, quantitative direct ELISA test which detects antibodies reactive to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the spike protein of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The assay is performed on 96-well plates coated with either SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD or spike proteins. The test is divided into two stages, a qualitative screening assay against RBD and a quantitative assay against the full-length spike protein. The test uses pooled high titer serum as a reference standard. Negative pre-COVID-19 and positive post-COVID-19, PCR-confirmed specimens were incorporated in each ELISA test run, and the assays were performed independently at two different locations. The Mount Sinai COVID-19 serology performed with high sensitivity and specificity, 92.5% (95% CI: 0.785-0.980) and 100% (CI: 0.939-1.000) respectively. Between-run precision was assessed with a single run repeated over 22 days; and within-run precision was assessed with 10 replicates per day over 22 days. Both were within reported acceptance criteria (CV ≤ 20%).

       "  'abstract': 'Exploring reliable and highly-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antibody diagnosis by point-of-care (POC) manner, holds great public health significance for extensive COVID-19 screening and controlling. Unfortunately, the currently applied gold based lateral flow immunoassay (GLFIA) may expose both false-negative and false-positive interpretations owing to the sensitivity and specificity limitations, which may cause significant risk and waste of public resources for large population screening. To simultaneously overcome the drawbacks of GLFIA, a novel fluorescent LFIA based on signal amplification and dual-antigen sandwich structure was established with largely improved sensitivity and specificity. The compact three-dimensional incorporation of hydrophobic quantum dots within dendritic affinity templates and multilayer surface derivation guaranteed a high and robust fluorescence of single label, which lowered the false negative rate of GLFIA prominently. A dual-antigen sandwich structure using labeled/immobilized SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain antigen for capturing total human SARS-CoV-2 antibody was developed, instead of general indirect antibody capturing approach, to reduce the false positive rate of GLFIA. Over 300 cases of COVID-19 negative and 97 cases of COVID-19 positive samples, the current assay revealed a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity confirmed by both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), compared with the considerable misinterpretation cases by currently applied GLFIA. The quantitative results verified by receiver operating characteristic curve and other statistical analysis indicated a well-distinguished positive/negative sample groups. The proposed strategy is highly sensitive towards low concentrated SARS-CoV-2 antibody serums and highly specific towards serums from COVID-19 negative persons and patients infected by other viruses.',\n",

First, intranasal and intratracheal challenge of eight pigs did not result in infection, based on clinical signs and PCR on swab and lung tissue samples. Two serum samples returned a low positive result in virus neutralization, in line with findings in other infection experiments in pigs. Next, a retrospective observational study was performed in the Netherlands in the spring of 2020. Serum samples (N =417) obtained at slaughter from 17 farms located in a region with a high human case incidence in the first wave of the pandemic. Samples were tested with protein micro array, plaque reduction neutralization test and receptor-binding-domain ELISA. None of the serum samples was positive in all three assays, although six samples from one farm returned a low positive result in PRNT (titers 40-80). Therefore we conclude that serological evidence for large scale transmission was not observed. Finally, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs on one farm, coinciding with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected animal caretakers, was investigated. Tonsil swabs and paired serum samples were tested. No evidence for infection with SARS-CoV-2 was found. In conclusion, Although in both the experimental and the observational study few samples returned low antibody titer results in PRNT infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not confirmed. It was concluded that sporadic infections in the field cannot be excluded, but large-scale SARS-CoV-2 transmission among pigs is unlikely.',\n",

Viruses can hijack the glycosylation machinery of host cells to shield themselves from the host's immune response and attenuate antibody efficiency. However, it remains unclear if targeting glycosylation on viral spike protein can impair infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.\\nWe adopted flow cytometry, ELISA, and BioLayer interferometry approaches to assess binding of glycosylated or deglycosylated spike with ACE2. Viral entry was determined by luciferase, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed a significant relationship between STT3A and COVID-19 severity. NF-κB/STT3A-regulated N-glycosylation was investigated by gene knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter assay. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that couples non-neutralization anti-spike antibody with NGI-1 (4G10-ADC) to specifically target SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.\\nThe receptor binding domain and three distinct SARS-CoV-2 surface N-glycosylation sites among 57,311 spike proteins retrieved from the NCBI-Virus-database are highly evolutionarily conserved (99.67%) and are involved in ACE2 interaction. STT3A is a key glycosyltransferase catalyzing spike glycosylation and is positively correlated with COVID-19 severity. We found that inhibiting STT3A using N-linked glycosylation inhibitor-1 (NGI-1) impaired SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that of its variants [Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351)]. Most importantly, 4G10-ADC enters SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and NGI-1 is subsequently released to deglycosylate spike protein, thereby reinforcing the neutralizing abilities of antibodies, vaccines, or convalescent sera and reducing SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity.\\nOur results indicate that targeting evolutionarily-conserved STT3A-mediated glycosylation via an ADC can exert profound impacts on SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity.

Most distinguishing mutations among variants of concern are exhibited in the NTD, localized to sites of high structural flexibility. Emerging variants of interest such as mu, lambda and C.1.2 exhibit the same patterns of mutations as variants of concern.

This paper reports the construction of the pVAX-RBD plasmid containing the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the S protein and a unique signal sequence 176 which promotes target protein secretion into the extracellular space thereby increasing the efficiency of humoral immune response activation. A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate (PGS) was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells. The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice. In particular, RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1 : 1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1 : 42000, in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group. The pVAX-RBD-PGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response. Using ELISpot, it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF-y in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool. The results suggest that the polyglucine-spermidine conjugate-enveloped pVAX-RBD construct may be considered as a promising DNA vaccine against COVID-19.',\n",

However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 host receptors with the exception of ACE2. Furthermore, ACE2 alone cannot explain the multi-organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting the involvement of other receptor(s). Here, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen 5054 human membrane proteins individually for interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein. Twelve proteins, including ACE2, ASGR1, and KREMEN1, were identified with diverse S-binding affinities and patterns. ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes distinct ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) receptor combinations to enter different cell types, and the expression of ASK together displays a markedly stronger correlation with virus susceptibility than that of any individual receptor at both the cell and tissue levels. The cocktail of ASK-related neutralizing antibodies provides the most substantial blockage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids when compared to individual antibodies. Our study revealed an interacting host receptome of SARS-CoV-2, and identified ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as alternative functional receptors that play essential roles in ACE2-independent virus entry, providing insight into SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis, as well as a community resource and potential therapeutic strategies for further COVID-19 investigations.',\n",

Acquiring a comprehensive knowledge of host-virus interaction is critical for designing effective vaccines and/or drugs. Understanding the evolution of the virus and the impact of genetic variability on host immune evasion and vaccine efficacy is helpful to design novel strategies to minimize the effects of the emerging variants of concern (VOC). Most vaccines under development and/or in current use target the spike protein owning to its unique function of host receptor binding, relatively conserved nature, potent immunogenicity in inducing neutralizing antibodies, and being a good target of T cell responses. However, emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains are exhibiting variability on the spike protein which could affect the efficacy of vaccines and antibody-based therapies in addition to enhancing viral immune evasion mechanisms. Currently, the degree to which mutations on the spike protein affect immunity and vaccination, and the ability of the current vaccines to confer protection against the emerging variants attracts much attention. This review discusses the implications of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations on immune evasion and vaccine-induced immunity and forward directions which could contribute to future studies focusing on designing effective vaccines and/or immunotherapies to consider viral evolution. Combining vaccines derived from different regions of the spike protein that boost both the humoral and cellular wings of adaptive immunity could be the best options to cope with the emerging VOC.',\n",

We constructed a vaccine candidate CoV-RBD121-NP, which is comprised of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S) fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain (CoV-RBD121) and conjugated to a modified tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) nanoparticle. In vitro, CoV-RBD121 bound to the host virus receptor ACE2 and to the monoclonal antibody CR3022, a neutralizing antibody that blocks S binding to ACE2. The CoV-RBD121-NP vaccine candidate retained key SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes, had consistent manufacturing release properties of safety, identity, and strength, and displayed stable potency when stored for 12 months at 2-8 °C or 22-28 °C. Immunogenicity studies revealed strong antibody responses in C57BL/6 mice with non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted (7909 CpG) formulations. The non-adjuvanted vaccine induced a balanced Th1/Th2 response and antibodies that recognized both the S1 domain and full S protein from SARS2-CoV-2, whereas the adjuvanted vaccine induced a Th1-biased response. Both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines induced virus neutralizing titers as measured by three different assays. Collectively, these data showed the production of a stable candidate vaccine for COVID-19 through the association of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the TMV-like nanoparticle.',\n",

The 252 samples were collected from multi-site NHS trusts and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Assay performance was evaluated between these three platforms and ROC curves were used to redefine the Abbott threshold. Concordance between Abbott and TBS was 66%. Any discrepant results were analysed using Roche, which showed 100% concordance with TBS. Analysis conducted in HCWs within 58 days post-PCR result demonstrated 100% sensitivity for both Abbott and Roche. Longitudinal analysis for >100 days post-PCR led to sensitivity of 77.2% and 100% for Abbott and Roche, respectively. A redefined Abbott threshold (0.64) increased sensitivity to 90%, producing results comparable to TBS and Roche. The manufacturer's threshold set by Abbott contributes to lower sensitivity and elevated false-negative occurrences. Abbott performance improved upon re-optimisation of the cut-off threshold.

Approximately a quarter of Sierra Leonian pre-pandemic blood samples had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, while about a third neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus.

The emergence of these \"variants of concern\" has increased immune escape and has supplanted the ancestral strains. The novel variants harbored by the B.1.617 lineage (kappa and delta) carry mutations within the receptor-binding domain of spike (S) protein (L452R + E484Q and L452R + T478K), the region binding to the host receptor. The double mutations carried by these novel variants are primarily responsible for an upsurge number of COVID-19 cases in India. In this study, we thoroughly investigated the impact of these double mutations on the binding capability to the human host receptor. We performed several structural analyses and found that the studied double mutations increase the binding affinity of the spike protein to the human host receptor (ACE2). Furthermore, our study showed that these double mutants might be a dominant contributor enhancing the receptor-binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently making it more stable. We also investigated the impact of these mutations on the binding affinity of two monoclonal antibodies (Abs) (2-15 and LY-CoV555) and found that the presence of the double mutations also hinders its binding with the studied Abs. The principal component analysis, free energy landscape, intermolecular interaction, and other investigations provided a deeper structural insight to better understand the molecular mechanism responsible for increased viral transmissibility of these variants.',\n",

Compared to other SARS-CoV-2 genes, mutations in the spike protein gene are more rapidly selected and spread within the population, which carries the risk of impairing the efficacy of spike-based vaccines. It is unclear to what extent the loss of neutralizing antibody epitopes can be compensated by cellular immune responses, and whether the use of other SARS-CoV-2 antigens might cause a more diverse immune response and better long-term protection, particularly in light of the continued evolution towards new SARS-CoV-2 variants. To address this question, we explored immunogenicity and protective effects of adenoviral vectors encoding either the full-length spike protein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N), the receptor binding domain (RBD) or a hybrid construct of RBD and the membrane protein (M) in a highly susceptible COVID-19 hamster model. All adenoviral vaccines provided life-saving protection against SARS-CoV-2-infection. The most efficient protection was achieved after exposure to full-length spike. However, the nucleocapsid protein, which triggered a robust T-cell response but did not facilitate the formation of neutralizing antibodies, controlled early virus replication efficiently and prevented severe pneumonia. Although the full-length spike protein is an excellent target for vaccines, it does not appear to be the only option for future vaccine design.',\n",

ORF3a-targeting antibodies may specifically and favorably modulate these viroporin-dependent pathological activities. However, suitable viroporin-targeting antibodies are difficult to generate because of the well-recognized technical challenge associated with isolating antibodies to complex transmembrane proteins. Here we exploited a naïve human single chain antibody phage display library, to isolate binders against carefully chosen ORF3a recombinant epitopes located towards the extracellular N terminal and cytosolic C terminal domains of the protein using peptide antigens. These binders were subjected to further characterization using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis to assess their binding affinities to the target epitopes. Binding to full-length ORF3a protein was evaluated by western blot and fluorescent microscopy using ORF3a transfected cells and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Co-localization analysis was also performed to evaluate the \"pairing potential\" of the selected binders as possible alternative diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 infections. Both ORF3a N and C termini, epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies were identified in our study. Whilst the linear nature of peptides might not always represent their native conformations in the context of full protein, with carefully designed selection protocols, we have been successful in isolating anti-ORF3a binders capable of recognising regions of the transmembrane protein that are exposed either on the \"inside\" or \"outside\" of the infected cell.

The highest titres were observed in individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, even against the delta variant.\\nImmunity acquired naturally after infection is highly dependent on the infecting variant, and, unexpectedly, mRNA-based vaccine efficacy was shown to be often better than natural immunity in eliciting neutralising antibodies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Global efforts are being made to monitor the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, aiming for early identification of genotypes providing increased infectivity or virulence. However, viral lineage-focused tracking might fail in early detection of advantageous mutations emerging independently across phylogenies. Here, the emergence patterns of Spike mutations were investigated in sequences deposited in local and global databases to identify mutational hotspots across phylogenies and we evaluated their impact on SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We found a striking increase in the frequency of recruitment of diverse substitutions at a critical residue (W152), positioned in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Spike protein, observed repeatedly across independent phylogenetic and geographical contexts. These mutations might have an impact on the evasion of neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we found that NTD is a region exhibiting particularly high frequency of mutation recruitments, suggesting an evolutionary path in which the virus maintains optimal efficiency of ACE2 binding combined with the flexibility facilitating the immune escape. We conclude that adaptive mutations, frequently present outside of the receptor-binding domain, can emerge in virtually any SARS-CoV-2 lineage and at any geographical location. Therefore, surveillance should not be restricted to monitoring defined lineages alone.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 is a highly contagious human infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the war with the virus is still underway. Since no specific drugs have been made available yet and there is an imbalance between supply and demand for vaccines, early diagnosis and isolation are essential to control the outbreak. Current nucleic acid testing methods require high sample quality and laboratory conditions, which cannot meet flexible applications. Here, we report a laser-induced graphene field-effect transistor (LIG-FET) for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The FET was manufactured by different reduction degree LIG, with an oyster reef-like porous graphene channel to enrich the binding point between the virus protein and sensing area. After immobilizing specific antibodies in the channel, the FET can detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 15 min at a concentration of 1 pg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 ng/mL in human serum. In addition, the sensor shows great specificity to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our sensors can realize fast production for COVID-19 rapid testing, as each LIG-FET can be fabricated by a laser platform in seconds. It is the first time that LIG has realized a virus sensing FET without any sample pretreatment or labeling, which paves the way for low-cost and rapid detection of COVID-19.',\n",

The level of neutralizing antibodies following the vaccination will evolve with time and vary between individuals. Immunoassays quantifying immunoglobulins against the viral spike (S) protein in serum/plasma have been developed, but the need for venous blood samples could limit the frequency and scale of control in populations. The use of a quantitative dried blood spot (DBS) that can be self-collected would simplify this monitoring. The objective of this study was to determine whether a quantitative DBS device (Capitainer qDBS 10 µL) could be used in combination with an Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay from Roche to follow the development and persistence of anti-S antibodies. This objective was carried out through two clinical studies. The first study investigated 14 volunteers who received two doses of the Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine. The levels of anti-S antibodies and the progression over time post-vaccination were studied for three months. The level of produced antibodies varied between subjects, but a similar trend was observed. The anti-S antibodies were highly stimulated by the second dose (×100) and peaked two weeks later. The antibody levels subsequently decreased and three months later were down to 65%. DBS proved to be sufficiently sensitive for use in evaluating the immune status against SARS-CoV-2 over a prolonged time. The second cohort was composed of 200 random patients from a clinical chemistry department in Stockholm. In this cohort, we had no information on previous COVID-19 infections or vaccination. Nevertheless, 87% of the subjects had anti-S immunoglobulins over 0.8 U/mL, and the bias between plasma and DBS proved to be variable, as was also seen in the first vaccination study.',\n",

In the present study, we studied humoral immunity in samples of the blood sera of COVID-19 convalescents of varying severity and patients who died due to this infection, using native SARS-CoV-2 and its individual recombinant proteins. The cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV (2002) was also assessed. We used infectious and inactivated SARS-CoV-2/human/RUS/Nsk-FRCFTM-1/2020 strain, inactivated SARS-CoV strain (strain Frankfurt 1, 2002), recombinant proteins, and blood sera of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The blood sera from patients were analyzed by the Virus Neutralization test, Immunoblotting, and ELISA. The median values and mean ± SD of titers of specific and cross-reactive antibodies in blood sera tested in ELISA were mainly distributed in the following descending order: N > trimer S > RBD. ELISA and immunoblotting revealed a high cross-activity of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-CoV antigen (2002), mainly with the N protein. The presence of antibodies specific to RBD corresponds with the data on the neutralizing activity of blood sera. According to the neutralization test in a number of cases, higher levels of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood serum taken from patients several days before their death than in convalescents with a ranging disease severity. This high level of neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood sera of patients who subsequently died in hospital from COVID-19 requires a thorough study of the role of humoral immunity as well as comorbidity and other factors affecting the humoral response in this disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since 2020, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been constantly mutating, producing most of the notable missense mutations in the context of \"variants of concern\", probably in response to the vaccine-driven alteration of immune profiles of the human population. The Delta variant, in particular, has become the most prevalent variant of the epidemic, and it is spreading in countries with the highest vaccination rates, causing the world to face the risk of a new wave of the contagion. Understanding the physical mechanism responsible for the mutation-induced changes in the RBD\\'s binding affinity, its transmissibility, and its capacity to escape vaccine-induced immunity is the \"urgent challenge\" in the development of preventive measures, vaccines, and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, entropy-enthalpy compensation and the Gibbs free energy change were used to analyze the impact of the RBD mutations on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants with the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and existing antibodies. Through the analysis, we found that the existing mutations have already covered almost all possible detrimental mutations that could result in an increase of transmissibility, and that a possible mutation in amino-acid position 498 of the RBD can potentially enhance its binding affinity. A new calculation method for the binding energies of protein-protein complexes is proposed based on the entropy-enthalpy compensation rule. All known structures of RBD-antibody complexes and the RBD-ACE2 complex comply with the entropy-enthalpy compensation rule in providing the driving force behind the spontaneous protein-protein docking. The variant-induced risk of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people is attributed to the L452R mutation\\'s reduction of the binding affinity of many antibodies. Mutations reversing the hydrophobic or hydrophilic performance of residues in the spike RBD potentially cause breakthrough infections of coronaviruses due to the changes in geometric complementarity in the entropy-enthalpy compensations between antibodies and the virus at the binding sites.',\n",

Here we perform deep profiling of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titer, Fc-receptor binding, and Fc-mediated functional assays in CP units, as well as in plasma from hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after CP administration. The profiling results show that, although all recipients exhibit expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses, CP units contain more functional antibodies than recipient plasma. Meanwhile, CP functional profiles influence the evolution of recipient humoral immunity in conjuncture with the recipient's pre-existing SARS-CoV2-specific antibody titers: CP-derived SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific antibody functions are associated with muted humoral immune evolution in patients with high titer anti-spike IgG. Our data thus provide insights into the unexpected impact of CP-derived functional anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2-specific response following severe infection.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Considering the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments. At present, neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule drugs such as remdesivir, the most promising compound to treat this infection, have attracted considerable attention. However, some potential problems need to be concerned including viral resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization caused by selective pressure from a single antibody treatment, the unexpected antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, and the toxic effect of small-molecule drugs.\\nHere, we constructed a type of programmed nanovesicle (NV) derived from bispecific CAR-T cells that express two single-chain fragment variables (scFv), named CR3022 and B38, to target SARS-CoV-2. Nanovesicles that express both CR3022 and B38 (CR3022/B38 NVs) have a stronger ability to neutralize Spike-pseudovirus infectivity than nanovesicles that express either CR3022 or B38 alone. Notably, the co-expression of CR3022 and B38, which target different epitopes of spike protein, could reduce the incidence of viral resistance. Moreover, the lack of Fc fragments on the surface of CR3022/B38 NVs could prevent ADE effects. Furthermore, the specific binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the drug loading capacity of CR3022/B38 NVs can facilitate targeted delivery of remdesiver to 293\\xa0T cells overexpressing spike protein. These results suggest that CR3022/B38 NVs have the potential ability to target antiviral drugs to the main site of viral infection, thereby enhancing the antiviral ability by inhibiting intracellular viral replication and reducing adverse drug reactions.\\nIn summary, we demonstrate that nanovesicles derived from CAR-T cells targeting the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 have the ability to neutralize Spike-pseudotyped virus and target antiviral drugs. This novel therapeutic approach may help to solve the dilemma faced by neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.',\n",

In this study, we constructed 10 pseudoviruses to study the Lambda variant and each individual amino acid mutation's effect on viral function, and used eight cell lines to study variant infectivity. In total, 12 monoclonal antibodies, 14 convalescent sera, and 23 immunized sera induced by mRNA vaccines, inactivated vaccine, and adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine were used to study the antigenicity of the Lambda variant.

Furthermore, convalescent- and vaccine-immunized sera showed on average 1.3-2.5-fold lower neutralizing titres against the Lambda variant.

We collected 710 serum samples (174 samples after BNT162b2 and 536 samples after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). Venous blood was obtained 3 weeks after first and second vaccinations. In both vaccines, sCOVG, CoV-2 IgG II, and cPASS showed a high seropositive rate (>95.7%) except for cPASS after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (68.8%). Using sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II, the ratios of antibody value (second/first) increased 10.6- and 11.4-fold in BNT162b2 (first 14.1, second 134.8 U/ml; first 1,416.2, second 14,326.4\\u2009AU/ml) and 2.3- and 2.0-fold in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (first 4.0, second 9.1 U/ml; first 431.0, second 9,744.0\\u2009AU/ml). cPASS-positive results indicated a very high concordance rate with sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II (>98%), whereas cPASS-negative results showed a relatively low concordance rate (range of 22.2% to 66.7%). To predict cPASS positivity, we suggested additional cutoffs for sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II at 2.42 U/ml and 284\\u2009AU/ml, respectively. In conclusion, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 evoked robust humoral responses. sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II showed a very strong correlation with cPASS. sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II may predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

       "  'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, uses its spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral membrane to enter host cells. The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by co-expression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to purify the Golgi-modified fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on other characterized S trimer preparations, is predominantly modified in the Golgi compartment by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions. ',\n",

The disease has caused more than 5.1 million deaths worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are frequently the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood.\\nIn this study, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes. We studied uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as pseudotyped viral particles by human iPS cell derived podocytes using qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes (including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33) associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing.\\nInfection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes.\\nThese results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes \\nMany patients with COVID19 disease exhibit multiorgan complications, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can extend beyond the respiratory system. Acute kidney injury is a common COVID-19 complication contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Still, SARS-Cov-2 affinity for specialized kidney cells remain less clear. By leveraging our protocol for stem cell differentiation, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney glomerular podocytes by using multiple Spike-binding proteins including ACE2 and BSG/CD147. Our results also indicate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause podocyte cell death and foot process effacement, a hallmark of podocytopathies including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.',\n",

Here we show that B38-CAP, an ACE2-like enzyme, is protective against SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury. Endogenous ACE2 expression is downregulated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, leading to elevation of angiotensin II levels. Recombinant Spike also downregulates ACE2 expression and worsens the symptoms of acid-induced lung injury. B38-CAP does not neutralize cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. However, B38-CAP treatment improves the pathologies of Spike-augmented acid-induced lung injury. In SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters or human ACE2 transgenic mice, B38-CAP significantly improves lung edema and pathologies of lung injury.

Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are now available, including mRNA-1273, which has shown 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to concerns of viral escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Several variants have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced immunity, most notably B.1.351 (Beta), although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. Here, we present the initial evaluation in mice of 2 updated mRNA vaccines designed to target SARS-CoV-2 variants: (1) monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the spike protein found in B.1.351 and (2) mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. Both vaccines were evaluated as a 2-dose primary series in mice; mRNA-1273.351 was also evaluated as a booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with mRNA-1273. The results demonstrated that a primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273.351 was effective at increasing neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.351, while mRNA-1273.211 was effective at providing broad cross-variant neutralization. A third (booster) dose of mRNA-1273.351 significantly increased both wild-type and B.1.351-specific neutralization titers. Both mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 are being evaluated in pre-clinical challenge and clinical studies.',\n",

We aimed to clarify whether SIgA in saliva cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit in individuals who have not been infected with this virus. The study involved 137 (men, n = 101; women, n = 36; mean age, 38.7; age range, 24-65 years) dentists and doctors from Kanagawa Dental University Hospital. Saliva and blood samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunochromatography for IgG and IgM, respectively. We then identified patients with saliva samples that were confirmed to be PCR-negative and IgM-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The cross-reactivity of IgA-positive saliva samples with SARS-CoV-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotin-labeled spike recombinant protein (S1-mFc) covering the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals was 46.7%, which correlated negatively with age (r = -0.218, p = 0.01). The proportion of IgA-positive individuals aged ≥50 years was significantly lower than that of patients aged ≤49 years (p = 0.008). SIgA was purified from the saliva of patients, which could partially suppress the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor. This study demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive SIgA in the saliva of individuals who had never been infected with the virus, suggesting that SIgA may help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are losing efficacy against emerging variants and may not protect against future novel coronavirus outbreaks, emphasizing the need for more broadly protective vaccines. To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We found an 11- to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2- to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in macaques and humans, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Young age, female sex, absence of comorbidities, and prior infection or vaccination are known epidemiological barriers for contracting the new infection and/or increased disease severity. Demographic trends from the recent coronavirus disease 2019 waves, which are believed to be driven by newer severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, indicate that the aforementioned epidemiological barriers are being breached and a larger number of younger and healthy individuals are developing severe disease. The new SARS-CoV-2 variants have key mutations that can induce significant changes in the virus-host interactions. Recent studies report that, some of these mutations, singly or in a group, enhance key mechanisms, such as binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the host-cells, increase the glycosylation of spike protein at the antigenic sites, and enhance the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein, thus leading to improved host-cell entry and the replication of the virus. The putative changes in the virus-host interactions imparted by the mutations in the RBD sequence can potentially be the reason behind the breach of the observed epidemiological barriers. Susceptibility for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease outcomes are known to be influenced by host-cell expressions of ACE2 and other proteases. The new variants can act more efficiently, and even with the lesser availability of the viral entry-receptor and the associated proteases, can have more efficient host-cell entry and greater replication resulting in high viral loads and prolonged viral shedding, widespread tissue-injury, and severe inflammation leading to increased transmissibility and lethality. Furthermore, the accumulating evidence shows that multiple new variants have reduced neutralization by both, natural and vaccine-acquired antibodies, indicating that repeated and vaccine breakthrough infections may arise as serious health concerns in the ongoing pandemic.',\n",

In addition, for antibodies that target the spike protein (SP), it's unclear if these reduce SARS-CoV-2/SP multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled SP-NIRF to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system and ex in vivo tissue analysis, in young mice. We found a SP body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. SP uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or CSF. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of SP into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-ACE2 and anti-SP antibodies suppressed SP biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-SP antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 multiorgan tropism, which could determine COVID-19 organ-specific outcomes.\",\n",

Serological response was evaluated by quantifying the Region-Binding-Domain (RBD) and neutralizing-antibodies. Cell-mediated response was analyzed by a whole-blood test quantifying interferon (IFN)-γ response to spike peptides. Cells responding to spike stimulation were identified by FACS analysis.\\nWe prospectively enrolled 186 vaccinated individuals: 78 HCWs and 108 MS patients. Twenty-eight MS patients were treated with IFN-β, 35 with fingolimod, 20 with cladribine, and 25 with ocrelizumab. A lower anti-RBD-antibody response rate was found in patients treated with ocrelizumab (40%, p<0.0001) and fingolimod (85.7%, p=0.0023) compared to HCWs and patients treated with cladribine or IFN-β. Anti-RBD-antibody median titer was lower in patients treated with ocrelizumab (p<0.0001), fingolimod (p<0.0001) and cladribine (p=0.010) compared to HCWs and IFN-β-treated patients. Importantly, serum neutralizing activity was present in all the HCWs tested and only in a minority of the fingolimod-treated patients (16.6%). T-cell-specific response was detected in the majority of MS patients (62%), albeit with significantly lower IFN-γ levels compared to HCWs. The lowest frequency of T-cell response was found in fingolimod-treated patients (14.3%). T-cell-specific response correlated with lymphocyte count and anti-RBD antibody titer (rho=0.554, p<0.0001 and rho=0.255, p=0.0078 respectively).

In this study, we present free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, performed at the end of December 2020, for the interactions of the spike S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody derived from COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interactions were significantly increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody dramatically decreased. The K417N mutation in a combination with N501Y fully abolished the antibody effect. However, Lys417Asn seems to have a compensatory mechanism of action increasing the S1 RBD-ACE2 free energy of binding. This may explain the increased spread of the virus observed in the U.K. and South Africa and also gives rise to an important question regarding the possible human immune response and the success of the already available vaccines. Notably, when the experimental data became available confirming our calculations, it was demonstrated that protein-protein FEP can be a useful tool for providing urgent data to the scientific community.',\n",

Protective antibody-mediated viral neutralization in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been firmly characterized. Where the effects of the antibody response are generally considered to be beneficial, an important biological question regarding potential negative outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody response has yet to be answered. We determined the distribution of IgG subclasses and complement activation levels in plasma from convalescent individuals using in-house developed ELISAs. The IgG response towards SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) after natural infection appeared to be mainly driven by IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, which are the main ligands for C1q mediated classical complement pathway activation. The deposition of the complement components C4b, C3bc, and TCC as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were depending primarily on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and significantly correlated with both IgG levels and disease severity, indicating that individuals with high levels of IgG and/or severe disease, might have a more prominent complement activation during viral infection. Finally, freshly isolated monocytes and a monocyte cell line (THP-1) were used to address the cellular mediated inflammatory response as a consequence of Fc-gamma receptor engagement by SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Monocytic Fc gamma receptor charging resulted in a significant rise in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α.

Many of these mutations are located in the Spike protein and some of them confer to the virus higher transmissibility or partial resistance to antibody mediated neutralization. Viral variants with such confirmed abilities are designated by WHO as Variants of Concern (VOCs). The aim of this study was to monitor the introduction of variants and VOCs in Venezuela. A small fragment of the viral genome was sequenced for the detection of the most relevant mutations found in VOCs. This approach allowed the detection of Gamma VOC. Its presence was confirmed by complete genome sequencing. The Gamma VOC was detected in Venezuela since January 2021, and in March 2021 was predominant in the East and Central side of the country, representing more than 95% of cases sequenced in all the country in April-May 2021. In addition to the Gamma VOC, other isolates carrying the mutation E484K were also detected. The frequency of this mutation has been increasing worldwide, as shown in a survey of sequences carrying E484K mutation in GISAID, and was detected in Venezuela in many probable cases of reinfection. Complete genome sequencing of these cases allowed us to identify E484K mutation in association with Gamma VOC and other lineages. In conclusion, the strategy adopted in this study is suitable for genomic surveillance of variants for countries lacking robust genome sequencing capacities. In the period studied, Gamma VOC seems to have rapidly become the dominant variant throughout the country.',\n",

Risk strata were determined by using regression models to predict infections by geographic area using census-level sociodemographic and health characteristics. We disproportionately sampled high and medium risk strata, which had smaller population sizes, to improve precision of estimates, and calculated a desired sample size of 3400. Participants were primarily recruited by mail and were followed monthly with PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, testing of venous blood samples for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, and testing of the presence of neutralizing antibodies, with completion of questionnaires about socio-demographics and behavior. Estimates of incidence and prevalence will be weighted by county, risk strata and sociodemographic characteristics of non-responders, and will take into account laboratory test performance.\\nWe enrolled 3842 adults from August to December 2020, and completed follow-up March 31, 2021. We reached target sample sizes within most strata.\\nOur stratified random sampling design will allow us to recruit a robust general population cohort of adults to determine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Identifying risk strata was unique to the design and will help ensure precise estimates, and high-performance testing for presence of virus and antibodies will enable accurate ascertainment of infections.',\n",

Here, we show that the stalk length is critical for the folding and stability of antibodies with an ultra-long CDR and that the disulfide bonds in the knob do not contribute to stability; they are important for organizing the antigen-binding knob structure. The bovine ultra-long CDR can be integrated into human antibody scaffolds. Furthermore, mini-domains from de novo design can be reformatted as ultra-long CDRs to create unique antibody-based proteins neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha variant of concern with high efficiency.

Here we perform a multifactorial analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antibody responses in pre-pandemic (N\\u2009=\\u2009825) and SARS-CoV-2-infected donors (N\\u2009=\\u2009389) using a custom-designed multiplex ABCORA assay. ABCORA seroprofiling, when combined with computational modeling, enables accurate definition of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and prediction of neutralization activity, and reveals intriguing interrelations with HCoV immunity. Specifically, higher HCoV antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-negative donors suggest that pre-existing HCoV immunity may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In those infected, higher HCoV activity is associated with elevated SARS-CoV-2 responses, indicating cross-stimulation. Most importantly, HCoV immunity may impact disease severity, as patients with high HCoV reactivity are less likely to require hospitalization. Collectively, our results suggest that HCoV immunity may promote rapid development of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity, thereby underscoring the importance of exploring cross-protective responses for comprehensive coronavirus prevention.',\n",

The receptor binding motif (RBM), located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, incorporates the majority of known ACE2 contact residues responsible for high affinity binding and associated virulence. Observation of existing crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (SRBD)-ACE2 interface, combined with peptide array screening, allowed us to define a series of linear native RBM-derived peptides that were selected as potential antiviral decoy sequences with the aim of directly binding ACE2 and attenuating viral cell entry. RBM1 (16mer): S443KVGGNYNYLYRLFRK458, RBM2A (25mer): E484GFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQPY508, RBM2B (20mer): F456NCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGY505 and RBM2A-Sc (25mer): NYGLQGSPFGYQETPYPFCNFVQYG. Data from fluorescence polarisation experiments suggested direct binding between RBM peptides and ACE2, with binding affinities ranging from the high nM to low μM range (Kd = 0.207-1.206 μM). However, the RBM peptides demonstrated only modest effects in preventing SRBD internalisation and showed no antiviral activity in a spike protein trimer neutralisation assay. The RBM peptides also failed to suppress S1-protein mediated inflammation in an endogenously expressing ACE2 human cell line. We conclude that linear native RBM-derived peptides are unable to outcompete viral spike protein for binding to ACE2 and therefore represent a suboptimal approach to inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry. These findings reinforce the notion that larger biologics (such as soluble ACE2, 'miniproteins', nanobodies and antibodies) are likely better suited as SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry inhibitors than short-sequence linear peptides.\",\n",

Understanding the antibody memory responses to infection is one tool needed to effectively control the pandemic. Among 173 outpatients who had virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated serum antibody concentrations, microneutralization activity, and enumerated SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells in convalescent blood specimens. Serum antibody concentrations were variable, allowing for stratification of the cohort into high and low responders. Serum antibody concentration was positively associated with microneutralization activity and participant age, with participants under the age of 30 showing the lowest antibody level. Neither participant sex, the timing of blood sampling following the onset of illness, nor the number of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific B cells correlated with serum antibody concentration. These data suggest that young adult outpatients did not generate as robust antibody memory, compared with older adults. Further, serum antibody concentration or neutralizing activity trended but did not significantly correlate with the number of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells. These findings have direct implications for public health policy and current vaccine efforts.

The spike proteins of B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 variants have several substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD), including L452R+E484Q, L452R+T478K, and K417N+L452R+T478K, respectively, that could potentially reduce effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and current vaccines. Here we compared B.1.617 variants, and their single and double RBD substitutions for resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Pseudoviruses with the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 spike showed a modest 1.5 to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for pseudoviruses with C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 spikes, but seven- and sixteen-fold reduction for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, was seen for pseudoviruses with the B.1.351 spike. Four of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses due to the L452R substitution, whereas six of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 pseudoviruses due to either the E484Q or L452R substitution. Against AY.1 pseudoviruses, the L452R and K417N substitutions accounted for the loss of neutralization by four antibodies and one antibody, respectively, whereas one antibody lost potency that could not be fully accounted for by a single RBD substitution. The modest resistance of B.1.617 variants to vaccine-elicited sera suggest that current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants, but the therapeutic antibodies need to be carefully selected based on their resistance profiles. Finally, the spike proteins of B.1.617 variants are more efficiently cleaved due to the P681R substitution, and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.',\n",

However, rare class 4 antibodies binding this conserved RBD supersite showed potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and all variants of concern. Structural analysis revealed that the neutralizing ability of cross-reactive antibodies was reserved only for those with an elongated CDRH3 that extends the antiparallel beta-sheet RBD core and orients the antibody light chain to obstruct ACE2-RBD interactions. These results identify a structurally defined pathway for vaccine strategies eliciting escape-resistant SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.',\n",

As the coronavirus flourish, the evolutionary pressure selects those variants that can complete the infection cycle faster and reproduce in large numbers compared to others. This increase in infectivity and transmissibility coupled with the immune response from high viral load may cause moderate to severe disease. Whether this leads to enhanced virulence in the prevalent Alpha and Delta variants is still not clear. This review describes the different types of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are now prevalent, their emergence, the mutations responsible for their growth advantages, and how they affect vaccine efficacy and increase chances of reinfection. Finally, we have also summarized the efforts made to recognize and predict the mutations, which can cause immune escape and track their emergence through impactful genomic surveillance.',\n",

CoronaVac, which is an inactivated virus vaccine, was the first imported COVID-19 vaccine in Thailand. To investigate the safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac within the Thai population, we conducted a prospective cohort study among health care workers aged 18-59 years, who received a 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac 21 days apart between March and April 2021 at the hospital in Samut Sakhon, Thailand. We recruited 185 participants with a mean age of 32 years. Total antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 were tested. Total antibodies against RBD were negative before immunization. One volunteer was positive for N, although negative for the RBD antibodies. The seroconversion rate of total antibodies against RBD after the first CoronaVac dose was 67% with a Geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 1.98 U/ml. Following CoronaVac dose 2, the seroconversion rate increased to 100% with a GMC of 92.9 U/ml. The seroconversion rates of IgG against N protein were 1% after dose 1 and 62.8% after dose 2. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 59.5%. Injection-site pain was the most common local adverse event (52.4%), while myalgia was the most common systemic adverse event (31.9%). No serious adverse events were observed. A 0-21 days, 2-dose CoronaVac regimen appears safe, inducing a satisfactory response compared with convalescent serum obtained 4-6 weeks postnatural infection. Antibody responses after 2-dose CoronaVac were comparable to the convalescent plasma but waned rapidly after 3 months. Therefore, we recommend 2-dose CoronaVac administration with possible booster doses.',\n",

To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants, we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417, E484, and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD). Despite this, we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.1.7 (alpha), P.1 (gamma), and B.1.617.2 (delta). Notably, antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants, suggesting that different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern.

To demonstrate the usefulness of the LFA, we tested previously infected and non-infected COVID-19 vaccine recipients at baseline and after first and second vaccine doses.\\nThe LFA compared favorably with SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays with an area under the ROC curve of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with seasonal coronaviruses did not show neutralizing activity in the LFA. After a single mRNA vaccine dose, 87% of previously infected individuals demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the complex immune responses toward SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we developed a method to express and purify the recombinant and engineered viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) to more than 95% purity. We could encapsulate RNA molecules into the interior of a virion-sized liposome. We conjugated the purified RBD proteins onto the surface of the liposome in an orientation-specific manner with defined spatial densities. Both the encapsulation of RNAs and the chemical conjugation of the RBD protein on liposome surfaces were stable under physiologically relevant conditions. In contrast to soluble RBD proteins, a single injection of RBD-conjugated liposomes alone, in the absence of any other adjuvants, elicited RBD-specific B cell responses in BALB/c mice, and the resulting animal sera could potently neutralize HIV-1 pseudovirions that displayed the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. These results validate these supramolecular structures as a novel and effective tool to mimic the structure of enveloped viruses, the use of which will allow systematic dissection of the complex B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The spike (S) protein is a leading vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The S1 domain of S protein, which contains a critical receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen, potentially induces protective immunoreactivities against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we presented preclinical evaluations of a novel insect cell-derived SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 (rS1) protein as a potent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The native antigenicity of rS1 was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting the RBD antigen. To improve its immunogenicity, rS1-adjuvanted with fucoidan/trimethylchitosan nanoparticles (FUC-TMC NPs) and cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) were investigated using a mouse model. The S1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers, FluoroSpot assay, pseudovirus- and prototype SARS-CoV-2-based neutralization assays were assessed. The results showed that the rS1/CpG/ FUC-TMC NPs (rS1/CpG/NPs) formulation induced a broad-spectrum IgG response with potent, long-lasting, and cross-protective neutralizing activity against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, along with a Th1-biased cellular response. Thus, the rS1/CpG/NPs formulation presents a promising vaccination approach against COVID-19.',\n",

It initiates entry into human cells by binding to the\\xa0peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\\xa0receptor via its receptor binding domain of S1 subunit of spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-RBD). Employing neutralizing antibodies to prevent binding between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 is an effective COVID-19 therapeutic solution. Previous studies found that CC12.3 is a highly potent neutralizing antibody that was isolated from a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient, and its Fab fragment (Fab CC12.3) bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable binding affinity to ACE2. To enhance its binding affinity, we employed computational protein design to redesign all CDRs of Fab CC12.3 and molecular dynamics (MD) to validate their predicted binding affinities by the MM-GBSA method. MD results show that the predicted binding affinities of the three best designed Fabs CC12.3 (CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08) are better than those of Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. Additionally, our results suggest that enhanced binding affinities of CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08 are caused by increased SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding interactions of CDRs L1 and L3. This study redesigned neutralizing antibodies with better predicted binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2-RBD than Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. They are promising candidates as neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

The newly emerged coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the primary reason for the COVID-19 global pandemic. According to recent global figures, COVID-19 has caused approximately 243.3 million illnesses and 4.9 million deaths. Several human cell receptors are involved in the virus identification of the host cells and entering them. Hence, understanding how the virus binds to host-cell receptors is crucial for developing antiviral treatments and vaccines. The current work aimed to determine the multiple host-cell receptors that bind with SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses for the purpose of cell entry. Extensive research is needed using neutralizing antibodies, natural chemicals, and therapeutic peptides to target those host-cell receptors in extremely susceptible individuals. More research is needed to map SARS-CoV-2 cell entry pathways in order to identify potential viral inhibitors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency requiring urgent development of efficacious vaccines. While concentrated research efforts have focused primarily on antibody-based vaccines that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccines have either been approved or received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring updated second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e., neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor-binding domain. Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2\\xa0S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2\\xa0S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins and present a new, to our knowledge, approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses.',\n",

Vaccination to prevent COVID-19 is recommended, but data on the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for patients with solid tumours receiving systemic cancer treatment are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy on the immunogenicity and safety of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna Biotech, Madrid, Spain) COVID-19 vaccine as part of the Vaccination Against COVID in Cancer (VOICE) trial.\\nThis prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial was done across three centres in the Netherlands. Individuals aged 18 years or older with a life expectancy of more than 12 months were enrolled into four cohorts: individuals without cancer (cohort A [control cohort]), and patients with solid tumours, regardless of stage and histology, treated with immunotherapy (cohort B), chemotherapy (cohort C), or chemoimmunotherapy (cohort D). Participants received two mRNA-1273 vaccinations of 100 μg in 0·5 mL intramuscularly, 28 days apart. The primary endpoint, analysed per protocol (excluding patients with a positive baseline sample [>10 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL], indicating previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), was defined as the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG serum antibody response (ie, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody concentration of >10 BAU/mL) 28 days after the second vaccination. For the primary endpoint analysis, a non-inferiority design with a margin of 10% was used. We also assessed adverse events in all patients who received at least one vaccination, and recorded solicited adverse events in participants who received at least one vaccination but excluding those who already had seroconversion (>10 BAU/mL) at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04715438.\\nBetween Feb 17 and March 12, 2021, 791 participants were enrolled and followed up for a median of 122 days (IQR 118 to 128). A SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody response was found in 240 (100%; 95% CI 98 to 100) of 240 evaluable participants in cohort A, 130 (99%; 96 to >99) of 131 evaluable patients in cohort B, 223 (97%; 94 to 99) of 229 evaluable patients in cohort C, and 143 (100%; 97 to 100) of 143 evaluable patients in cohort D. The SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody response in each patient cohort was non-inferior compared with cohort A. No new safety signals were observed. Grade 3 or worse serious adverse events occurred in no participants in cohort A, three (2%) of 137 patients in cohort B, six (2%) of 244 patients in cohort C, and one (1%) of 163 patients in cohort D, with four events (two of fever, and one each of diarrhoea and febrile neutropenia) potentially related to the vaccination. There were no vaccine-related deaths.\\nMost patients with cancer develop, while receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or both for a solid tumour, an adequate antibody response to vaccination with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is also safe in these patients.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine among transplant recipients.

       "  'abstract': 'In the last 25\\xa0years, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has had a major impact in the successful treatment of previously untreatable or poorly controlled autoimmune neurological disorders. Derived from thousands of healthy donors, IVIg contains IgG1 isotypes of idiotypic antibodies that have the potential to bind pathogenic autoantibodies or cross-react with various antigenic peptides, including proteins conserved among the \"common cold\"-pre-pandemic coronaviruses; as a result, after IVIg infusions, some of the patients\\' sera may transiently become positive for various neuronal antibodies, even for anti-SARS-CoV-2, necessitating caution in separating antibodies derived from the infused IVIg or acquired humoral immunity. IVIg exerts multiple effects on the immunoregulatory network by variably affecting autoantibodies, complement activation, FcRn saturation, FcγRIIb receptors, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators. Based on randomized controlled trials, IVIg is approved for the treatment of GBS, CIDP, MMN and dermatomyositis; has been effective in, myasthenia gravis exacerbations, and stiff-person syndrome; and exhibits convincing efficacy in autoimmune epilepsy, neuromyelitis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Recent evidence suggests that polymorphisms in the genes encoding FcRn and FcγRIIB may influence the catabolism of infused IgG or its anti-inflammatory effects, impacting on individualized dosing or efficacy. For chronic maintenance therapy, IVIg and subcutaneous IgG are effective in controlled studies only in CIDP and MMN preventing relapses and axonal loss up to 48\\xa0weeks; in practice, however, IVIg is continuously used for years in all the aforementioned neurological conditions, like is a \"forever necessary therapy\" for maintaining stability, generating challenges on when and how to stop it. Because about 35-40% of patients on chronic therapy do not exhibit objective neurological signs of worsening after stopping IVIg but express subjective symptoms of fatigue, pains, spasms, or a feeling of generalized weakness, a conditioning effect combined with fear that discontinuing chronic therapy may destabilize a multi-year stability status is likely. The dilemmas of continuing chronic therapy, the importance of adjusting dosing and scheduling or periodically stopping IVIg to objectively assess necessity, and concerns in accurately interpreting IVIg-dependency are discussed. Finally, the merit of subcutaneous IgG, the ineffectiveness of IVIg in IgG4-neurological autoimmunities, and genetic factors affecting IVIg dosing and efficacy are addressed.',\n",

However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with enhanced transmissibility and altered antigenicity requires broad-spectrum therapies.

Six neutralizing mAbs that exhibited high-affinity binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were identified, and their amino acid sequences were determined by mass spectrometry. Functional assays confirmed that three mAbs, F461G11, F461G15, and F461G16 neutralized four variants of concern (VOC): B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.2 (delta) These mAbs are promising candidates for COVID-19 therapy, and understanding their interactions with virus spike protein should support further vaccine and antibody development.',\n",

In an effort to develop therapeutic interventions and control the pandemic, scientists have isolated several neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from the vaccinated and convalescent individuals. These antibodies can be explored further to understand SARS-CoV-2 specific antigen-antibody interactions and biophysical parameters related to binding affinity, which can be utilized to engineer more potent antibodies for current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the present study, we have analyzed the interface between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibodies in terms of amino acid residue propensity, pair preference, and atomic interaction energy. We observed that Tyr residues containing contacts are highly preferred and energetically favorable at the interface of spike protein-antibody complexes. We have also developed a regression model to relate the experimental binding affinity for antibodies using structural features, which showed a correlation of 0.93. Moreover, several mutations at the spike protein-antibody interface were identified, which may lead to immune escape (epitope residues) and improved affinity (paratope residues) in current/emerging variants. Overall, the work provides insights into spike protein-antibody interactions, structural parameters related to binding affinity and mutational effects on binding affinity change, which can be helpful to develop better therapeutics against COVID-19.',\n",

The database includes simulations produced by leading groups using molecular dynamics (MD) methods to investigate the structure-dynamics-function relationships of viral proteins. SCoV2-MD cross-references the molecular data with the pandemic evolution by tracking all available variants sequenced during the pandemic and deposited in the GISAID resource. SCoV2-MD enables the interactive analysis of the deposited trajectories through a web interface, which enables users to search by viral protein, isolate, phylogenetic attributes, or specific point mutation. Each mutation can then be analyzed interactively combining static (e.g. a variety of amino acid substitution penalties) and dynamic (time-dependent data derived from the dynamics of the local geometry) scores. Dynamic scores can be computed on the basis of nine non-covalent interaction types, including steric properties, solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding, and other types of chemical interactions. Where available, experimental data such as antibody escape and change in binding affinities from deep mutational scanning experiments are also made available. All metrics can be combined to build predefined or custom scores to interrogate the impact of evolving variants on protein structure and function.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are genetically related coronavirus and share the same cellular receptor ACE2. By replacing the VSV glycoprotein with the spikes (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we generated two replication-competent recombinant viruses, rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 and rVSV-SARS-CoV. Using wild-type and human ACE2 (hACE2) knock-in mouse models, we found a single dose of rVSV-SARS-CoV could elicit strong humoral immune response via both intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) routes. Despite the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, no obvious cross-neutralizing activity was observed in the immunized mice sera. In macaques, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers induced by one i.n. dose of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 were eight-fold higher than those by a single i.m. dose. Thus, our data indicates that rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 might be suitable for i.n. administration instead of the traditional i.m. immunization in human. Because rVSV-SARS-CoV elicited significantly stronger NAb responses than rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 in a route-independent manner, we generated a chimeric antigen by replacing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S with that from the SARS-CoV-2. rVSV expressing the chimera (rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD) induced significantly increased NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and macaques than rVSV-SARS-CoV-2, with a safe Th1-biased response. Serum immunized with rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD showed no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV. hACE2 mice receiving a single i.m. dose of either rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 or rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD were fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge without obvious lesions in the lungs. Our results suggest that transplantation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD into the S protein of SARS-CoV might be a promising antigen design for COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were responders cocultured with hUCMSCs or exogenous IL-6. A PBMC suppression assay was used to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects via MTT assay. The IL-6 concentration in the supernatant was measured using ELISA. The correlation between the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCMSCs and IL-6 levels and the relevant roles of IL-6 and IL-6 mRNA expression was analyzed using the MetaCore functional network constructed from gene microarray data. The location of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression was further evaluated. We reported that hUCMSCs did not initially exert any inhibitory effect on PHA-stimulated proliferation; however, a potent inhibitory effect on PHA-stimulated proliferation was observed, and the IL-6 concentration reached approximately 1000 ng/mL after 72 hours. Exogenous 1000 ng/mL IL-6 inhibited PHA-stimulated inflammation but less so than hUCMSCs. The inhibitory effects of hUCMSCs on PHA-stimulated PBMCs disappeared after adding an IL-6 neutralizing antibody or pretreatment with tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6R antagonist. hUCMSCs exert excellent anti-inflammatory effects by inducing higher IL-6 levels, which is different from TCZ. High concentration of IL-6 cytokine secretion plays an important role in the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCMSC therapy. Initial hUCMSC therapy, followed by TCZ, seems to optimize the therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).',\n",

The objective of this study was the development of the first downstream unit operations for cell-culture-derived rVSV-S, namely, the removal of nucleic acid contamination, the clarification and concentration of viral harvested supernatant, and buffer exchange. Retaining the infectivity of the rVSV-S during the downstream process was challenged by the shear sensitivity of the enveloped rVSV-S and its membrane protruding spike protein. Through a series of screening experiments, we evaluated and established the required endonuclease treatment conditions, filter train composition, and hollow fiber-tangential flow filtration parameters to remove large particles, reduce the load of impurities, and concentrate and exchange the buffer while retaining rVSV-S infectivity. The combined effect of the first unit operations on viral recovery and the removal of critical impurities was examined during scale-up experiments. Overall, approximately 40% of viral recovery was obtained and the regulatory requirements of less than 10\\xa0ng host cell DNA per dose were met. However, while 86-97% of the host cell proteins were removed, the regulatory acceptable HCP levels were not achieved, requiring subsequent purification and polishing steps.

We could analyze mutation dynamics across the genome from countries such as the USA, Italy, the UK, France, Brazil, and India considering the rapid mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The analysis would help us to understand the genome diversity, the implications of the mutations in protein stability, and viral transmission. Among the 11 genes, surface glycoprotein (S) was singled out because of its crucial function associated with the entry of virion into the human cell upon binding with the hACE2 receptor. 749 S protein sequences from India were retrieved from the NCBI database for our study. The S protein is an important antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses, neutralizing antibodies, and\\xa0providing protective immunity against viral infection. During an epitope prediction from a mutation-prone S-protein region, it is necessary to ascertain how new mutations significantly change the S protein, such that our vaccine is effective against all the mutated strains as well. The S1 region of the S protein had been our prime focus for identifying immune epitopes against SARS-COV-2. Antigenic B- cell epitopes were YYPDKVF from NTD and LFRKSNLKP from RBD. Cytotoxic T-cell epitopes WTAGAAAYY (within NTD) and CVADYSVLY (within RBD) exhibited binding with a maximum number of MHC I alleles. The T-cell epitopes which showed a maximum affinity for MHC II alleles were FLPFFSNVT within NTD and YFPLQSYGF within RBD. Furthermore, the best epitopes were characterized in terms of their physicochemical properties to establish their potentiality.',\n",

This is thought to be associated with an impaired activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and which also tightly regulates blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) to a vasopressor peptide. Here, we show that a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies against AngII, whose presence correlates with lower blood oxygenation, blood pressure dysregulation, and overall higher disease severity. Anti-AngII antibodies can develop upon specific immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike or RBD, to which they can cross-bind, suggesting some epitope mimicry between AngII and Spike/RBD.

Due to the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact, it is paramount to find effective treatments against it. Human neutralizing antibodies are an effective method to fight viral infection. However, the recent discovery of new strains that substantially change the S-protein sequence has raised concern about vaccines and antibodies' effectiveness. Here, using molecular simulations, we investigated the binding mechanisms between the S-protein and several antibodies. Multiple mutations were included to understand the strategies for antibody escape in new variants. We found that the combination of mutations K417N, E484K, L452R, and T478K produced higher binding energy to ACE2 than the wild type, suggesting higher efficiency to enter host cells. The mutations' effect depends on the antibody class. While Class I enhances the binding avidity in the presence of N501Y mutation, class II antibodies showed a sharp decline in the binding affinity. Our simulations suggest that Class I antibodies will remain effective against the new strains. In contrast, Class II antibodies will have less affinity to the S-protein, potentially affecting these antibodies' efficiency.\",\n",

A total of 8476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after a vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, Common CoV, and Influenza. Twenty-six percent of specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; out of 852 seropositive individuals 77 had symptoms and 9 sought medical care. The antibody response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length, and S2 domain of spike. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and not cross-reactive against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. A vaccination campaign at the University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC) started on December, 2020 and 6724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. Seroprevalence increased from 13% pre-vaccination to 79% post-vaccination in January, 93% in February, and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced higher antibody levels than natural exposure, especially against the RBD domain and cross-reactivity against SARS RBD and S1 was observed. Nucleocapsid protein antibodies can be used to distinguish vaccinees to classify pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Previously infected individuals developed higher antibody titers to the vaccine than non pre-exposed individuals. Hospitalized patients in intensive care with severe disease reach significantly higher antibody levels than mild cases, but lower antibody levels compared to the vaccine. These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much stronger and broader antibody response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

We demonstrate that a late viral isolate exhibiting genome mutations similar to those found in variants of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil, can escape neutralization by COVID-19 antisera. Moreover, infection of susceptible mice with this patient's escape variant elicits protective immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus and the escape variant, as well as high neutralization titers against the alpha and beta SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, demonstrating a considerable immune control against such variants of concern. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment, the patient generated spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection.

       "  'abstract': 'Extensive glycosylation of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus not only shields the major part of it from host immune responses, but glycans at specific sites also act on its conformation dynamics and contribute to efficient host receptor binding, and hence infectivity. As variants of concern arise during the course of the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic, it is unclear if mutations accumulated within the spike protein would affect its site-specific glycosylation pattern. The Alpha variant derived from the D614G lineage is distinguished from others by having deletion mutations located right within an immunogenic supersite of the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) that make it refractory to most neutralizing antibodies directed against this domain. Despite maintaining an overall similar structural conformation, our mass spectrometry-based site-specific glycosylation analyses of similarly produced spike proteins with and without the D614G and Alpha variant mutations reveal a significant shift in the processing state of N-glycans on one specific NTD site. Its conversion to a higher proportion of complex type structures is indicative of altered spatial accessibility attributable to mutations specific to the Alpha variant that may impact its transmissibility. This and other more subtle changes in glycosylation features detected at other sites provide crucial missing information otherwise not apparent in the available cryogenic electron microscopy-derived structures of the spike protein variants.',\n",

The frequent emergence of immune escape variants have spurred the search for prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies that confer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The crystal structure of n3113 in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, combined with the cryo-EM structures of n3113 and spike ecto-domain, reveals that n3113 binds to the side surface of up-state RBD with no competition with ACE2.

       "  'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 virus is rapidly evolving via mutagenesis, lengthening the pandemic, and threatening the public health. Until August 2021, 12 variants of SARS-CoV-2 named as variants of concern (VOC; Alpha to Delta) or variants of interest (VOI; Epsilon to Mu), with significant impact on transmissibility, morbidity, possible reinfection and mortality, have been identified. The VOC Delta (B.1.617.2) of Indian origin is now the dominant and the most contagious variant worldwide as it provokes a strong binding to the human ACE2 receptor, increases transmissibility and manifests considerable immune escape strategies after natural infection or vaccination. Although the development and administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, based on different technologies (mRNA, adenovirus carrier, recombinant protein, etc.), are very promising for the control of the pandemic, their effectiveness and neutralizing activity against VOCs varies significantly. In this review, we describe the most significant circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, and the known effectiveness of currently available vaccines against them.',\n",

Maternal and neonatal systemic immune responses were investigated by detecting spike-specific antibodies in serum, and the mucosal immune response was assessed by measuring specific antibodies in maternal breastmilk and infant saliva 48 hours after delivery and 2 months later.\\nMaternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnancy.\\nThe systemic immune response was evaluated by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies and receptor binding domain-specific IgM antibodies in maternal and neonatal serum. The mucosal immune response was assessed by measuring spike-specific antibodies in breastmilk and in infant saliva, and the presence of antigen-antibody spike IgA immune complexes was investigated in breastmilk samples. All antibodies were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\\nIn total, 28 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] maternal age, 31.8 [6.4] years; mean [SD] gestational age, 38.1 [2.3] weeks; 18 [60%] male infants) were enrolled at delivery, and 21 dyads completed the study at 2 months' follow-up. Because maternal infection was recent in all cases, transplacental transfer of virus spike-specific IgG antibodies occurred in only 1 infant. One case of potential vertical transmission and 1 case of horizontal infection were observed. Virus spike protein-specific salivary IgA antibodies were significantly increased (P\\u2009=\\u2009.01) in infants fed breastmilk (0.99 arbitrary units [AU]; IQR, 0.39-1.68 AU) vs infants fed an exclusive formula diet (0.16 AU; IQR, 0.02-0.83 AU). Maternal milk contained IgA spike immune complexes at 48 hours (0.53 AU; IQR, 0.25-0.39 AU) and at 2 months (0.09 AU; IQR, 0.03-0.17 AU) and may have functioned as specific stimuli for the infant mucosal immune response.\\nIn this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgA antibodies were detected in infant saliva, which may partly explain why newborns are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mothers infected in the peripartum period appear to not only passively protect the newborn via breastmilk secretory IgA but also actively stimulate and train the neonatal immune system via breastmilk immune complexes.\",\n",

In this observational study of mucosal and systemic humoral immunity in acutely infected, convalescent, and vaccinated subjects, we tested for cross reactivity against endemic CoV spike (S) protein at subdomain resolution. Elevated responses, particularly to the β-CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross react. While further research is needed to discern whether this recalled response is desirable or detrimental, the boosted antibodies principally targeted the better conserved S2 subdomain of the viral spike and were not associated with neutralization activity. In contrast, vaccination with a stabilized spike mRNA vaccine did not robustly boost cross-reactive antibodies, suggesting differing antigenicity and immunogenicity. In sum, this study provides evidence that antibodies targeting endemic CoV are robustly boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not to vaccination with stabilized S, and that depending on conformation or other factors, the S2 subdomain of the spike protein triggers a rapidly recalled, IgG-dominated response that lacks neutralization activity.',\n",

These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race and/or ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serologic evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicago's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies. Overall, these findings of comparable exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across neighborhoods with very disparate COVID-19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health, and the co-morbidities related to them, driving differences in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.\",\n",

Thereafter, we identified the baculovirus gp64 signal peptide-directed secretion of LV-MS1-Fc protein in the extracellular fluid. To demonstrate the immunogenicity of the recombinant LV-MS1-Fc proteins, BALB/c mice were inoculated with 2.5 μg of LV-MS1-Fc. The inoculated mice demonstrated a significant humoral immune response, measured via total IgG and neutralizing antibodies. In addition, human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) transgenic mice vaccinated with LV-MS1-Fc showed the protective capacity of LV-MS1-Fc against MERS-CoV with no inflammatory cell infiltration. These data showed that the S1 and Fc fusion protein induced potent humoral immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, and conferred protection against coronavirus viral challenge, indicating that LV-MS1-Fc is an effective vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.',\n",

It is not yet clear whether heterotypic boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin, where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new one, or whether the memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs.

       "  'abstract': 'Limitations in laboratory testing capacity undermine the ability to quantify the overall burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\\nWe undertook a population-based serosurvey for SARS-CoV-2 infection in 26 subdistricts, Gauteng Province (population 15.9 million), South Africa, to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection fatality rate (IFR) triangulating seroprevalence, recorded COVID-19 deaths and excess-mortality data. We employed three-stage random household sampling with a selection probability proportional to the subdistrict size, stratifying the subdistrict census-sampling frame by housing type and then selecting households from selected clusters. The survey started on 4 November 2020, 8 weeks after the end of the first wave (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test positivity had declined to <10% for the first wave) and coincided with the peak of the second wave. The last sampling was performed on 22 January 2021, which was 9 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 resurgence. Serum SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was measured using a quantitative assay on the Luminex platform.\\nFrom 6332 individuals in 3453 households, the overall RBD IgG seroprevalence was 19.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 18.1-20.1%] and similar in children and adults. The seroprevalence varied from 5.5% to 43.2% across subdistricts. Conservatively, there were 2 897 120 (95% CI: 2 743 907-3 056 866) SARS-CoV-2 infections, yielding an infection rate of 19 090 per 100 000 until 9 January 2021, when 330 336 COVID-19 cases were recorded. The estimated IFR using recorded COVID-19 deaths (n = 8198) was 0.28% (95% CI: 0.27-0.30) and 0.67% (95% CI: 0.64-0.71) assuming 90% of modelled natural excess deaths were due to COVID-19 (n = 21 582). Notably, 53.8% (65/122) of individuals with previous self-reported confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were RBD IgG seronegative.\\nThe calculated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 7.8-fold greater than the recorded COVID-19 cases. The calculated SARS-CoV-2 IFR varied 2.39-fold when calculated using reported COVID-19 deaths (0.28%) compared with excess-mortality-derived COVID-19-attributable deaths (0.67%). Waning RBD IgG may have inadvertently underestimated the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and conversely overestimated the mortality risk. Epidemic preparedness and response planning for future COVID-19 waves will need to consider the true magnitude of infections, paying close attention to excess-mortality trends rather than absolute reported COVID-19 deaths.',\n",

Administered in combinations, these mAbs provided low-dose protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mouse model, using both neutralization and Fc effector antibody functions. The RBD mAb WRAIR-2125, which targets residue F486 through a unique heavy-chain and light-chain pairing, demonstrated potent neutralizing activity against all major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In combination with NTD and other RBD mAbs, WRAIR-2125 also prevented viral escape. These data demonstrate that NTD/RBD mAb combinations confer potent protection, likely leveraging complementary mechanisms of viral inactivation and clearance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Coronaviruses are evolutionarily successful RNA viruses, common to multiple avian, amphibian and mammalian hosts. Despite their ubiquity and potential impact, knowledge of host immunity to coronaviruses remains incomplete, partly owing to the lack of overt pathogenicity of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), which typically cause common colds. However, the need for deeper understanding became pressing with the zoonotic introduction of three novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, causing severe acute respiratory syndromes in humans, and the unfolding pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This renewed interest not only triggered the discovery of two of the four HCoVs, but also uncovered substantial cellular and humoral cross-reactivity with shared or related coronaviral antigens. Here, we review the evidence for cross-reactive B cell memory elicited by HCoVs and its potential impact on the puzzlingly variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available data indicate targeting of highly conserved regions primarily in the S2 subunits of the spike glycoproteins of HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive B cells and antibodies. Rare monoclonal antibodies reactive with conserved S2 epitopes and with potent virus neutralising activity have been cloned, underscoring the potential functional relevance of cross-reactivity. We discuss B cell and antibody cross-reactivity in the broader context of heterologous humoral immunity to coronaviruses, as well as the limits of protective immune memory against homologous re-infection. Given the bidirectional nature of cross-reactivity, the unprecedented current vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 is expected to impact HCoVs, as well as future zoonotic coronaviruses attempting to cross the species barrier. However, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with resistance to neutralisation by vaccine-induced antibodies highlight a need for targeting more constrained, less mutable parts of the spike. The delineation of such cross-reactive areas, which humoral immunity can be trained to attack, may offer the key to permanently shifting the balance of our interaction with current and future coronaviruses in our favour.',\n",

We tested participants for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins using the Roche Elecsys immunoassays. We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence following vaccination and/or infection (anti-S antibodies), or infection only (anti-N antibodies).ResultsAmong 3,355 individuals (54.1% women; 20.8% aged\\u2009<\\u200918 years and 13.4% aged\\u2009≥\\u200965 years), 2,161 (64.4%) had anti-S antibodies and 906 (27.0%) had anti-N antibodies. The total seroprevalence was 66.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 64.1-68.0). We estimated that 29.9% (95% Crl: 28.0-31.9) of the population developed antibodies after infection; the rest having developed antibodies via vaccination. Seroprevalence estimates differed markedly across age groups, being lowest among children aged 0-5 years (20.8%; 95% Crl: 15.5-26.7) and highest among older adults aged\\u2009≥\\u200975 years (93.1%; 95% Crl: 89.6-96.0). Seroprevalence of antibodies developed via infection and/or vaccination was higher among participants with higher educational level.ConclusionMost of the population has developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, despite most teenagers and children remaining vulnerable to infection. As the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spreads and vaccination rates stagnate, efforts are needed to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among younger individuals and to minimise spread among children.',\n",

This study was performed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies within the domestic cat population in Istanbul, Turkey, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, from 155 cat sera analyzed, 26.45% (41/155) tested positive in the spike protein-ELISA (S-ELISA), 28.38% (44/155) in the receptor-binding domain-ELISA (RBD-ELISA), and 21.9% (34/155) in both, the S- and RBD-ELISAs. Twenty-seven of those were also positive for the presence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV). Among the 34 SARS-CoV-2-positive sera, three of those were positive on serum neutralization assay. Six of the 30 cats before COVID-19 and 28 of the 125 cats during COVID-19 were found to be seropositive. About 20% of ELISA-positive cats exhibited mainly respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal signs and skin lesions. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cells, lymphocyte, and platelet numbers were low in about 30% of ELISA-positive cats. The number of neutrophils and monocytes were above normal values in about 20% of ELISA-positive cats. The liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase levels were high in 23.5% ELISA-positive cats. In conclusion, this is the first report describing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S and RBD) in cats in Istanbul, Turkey, indicating the risk for domestic cats to contract SARS-CoV-2 from owners and/or household members with COVID-19. This study and others show that COVID-19-positive pet owners should limit their contact with companion animals and that pets with respiratory signs should be monitored for SARS-CoV-2 infections.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vaccination of the global population against COVID-19 is a great scientific, logistical, and moral challenge. Despite the rapid development and authorization of several full-length Spike (S) protein vaccines, the global demand outweighs the current supply and there is a need for safe, potent, high-volume, affordable vaccines that can fill this gap, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccines could fill this gap has been debated, especially with regards to its suitability to protect against emerging viral variants of concern. Given a predominance for elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target RBD following natural infection or vaccination, a key biomarker of protection, there is merit for selection of RBD as a sole vaccine immunogen. With its high-yielding production and manufacturing potential, RBD-based vaccines offer an abundance of temperature-stable doses at an affordable cost. In addition, as the RBD preferentially focuses the immune response to potent and recently recognized cross-protective determinants, this domain may be central to the development of future pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. In this study, we review the data supporting the non-inferiority of RBD as a vaccine immunogen compared to full-length S-protein vaccines with respect to humoral and cellular immune responses against both the prototype pandemic SARS-CoV-2 isolate and emerging variants of concern.',\n",

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM -CSF) has been proved to be effective in promoting lymphocyte regeneration, but adverse immunological effects have also emerged. This study aim to investigate the effect of GM -CSF on BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire while promoting lymphocyte regeneration. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and GM -CSF were used to inhibit and stimulate bone marrow hematopoiesis, respectively. High throughput sequencing was applied to detect the characteristics of BCR CDR3 repertoire in controls, CTX group and GM -CSF group. The white blood cells (WBCs) were quickly reduced (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) with lymphocytes decreasing causing by CTX, and the WBCs and lymphocytes returned to the level of controls after GM -CSF treatment. The diversity of BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire was also significantly decreased in CTX group. Although there is still a big gap from the controls, the diversity was picked up after GM -CSF treatment. The expression of IGHD01-01, IGHD02-14 and IGHJ04-01 with high-frequency usage regularly and significantly changed in three groups, and many genes with low-frequency usage lost in CTX group and did not reappear in GM -CSF group. Moreover, two shared sequences and accounted for the highest proportion in GM -CSF group have been detected in animal model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These results revealed that GM -CSF can partially restore changes in the BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire while promoting lymphocyte regeneration, but it may also lead to rearrangement, proliferation and activation of abnormal B cells, which can provide a basis for further study on the adverse immunological effects and mechanism of GM -CSF treatment.',\n",

However, the development of specific vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is not the only approach to control the virus and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) start to merit special attention as a therapeutic option to treat COVID-19 disease. Here, the main conformations and interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (S protein) with two mAbs (CR3022 and S309) and the ACE2 cell receptor are studied as the main representatives of three different epitopes on the RBD of S protein. The combined approach of 1 μs accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) and ab-initio hybrid molecular dynamics is used to identify the most predominant interactions under physiological conditions. Results allow to determine the main receptor-binding mapping, hydrogen bonding network and salt bridges in the most populated antigen-antibody interface conformations.

The main objective of the present study was to compare the Ab titers obtained with quantitative commercial binding Ab assays, after one dose (convalescent individuals) or two doses (naive individuals) of vaccine, in health care workers (HCW). Antibody titers were measured in 255 sera (from 150 HCW) with five quantitative immunoassays (Abbott RBD IgG II quant, bioMérieux RBD IgG, DiaSorin Trimeric spike IgG, Siemens Healthineers RBD IgG, Wantai RBD IgG). One qualitative total antibody anti-RBD detection assay (Wantai) was used to detect previous infection before vaccination. The results are presented in binding Ab units (BAU)/mL after application, when possible, of a conversion factor provided by the manufacturers and established from a World Health Organization internal standard. There was a 100% seroconversion with all assays evaluated after two doses of vaccine. With assays allowing BAU/mL correction, Ab titers were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, ρ, range: 0.85-0.94). The titer differences varied by a mean of 10.6% between Siemens and bioMérieux assays to 60.9% between Abbott and DiaSorin assays. These results underline the importance of BAU conversion for the comparison of Ab titer obtained with the different quantitative assays. However, significant differences persist, notably, between kits detecting Ab against the different antigens. A true standardization of the assays would be to include the International Standard in the calibration of each assay to express the results in IU/mL.',\n",

As vaccines become increasingly available, it is important to identify reliable methods for measuring neutralizing antibody responses that correlate with authentic virus neutralization but can be performed outside biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories. While many neutralizing assays using pseudotyped virus have been developed, there have been few studies comparing the different assays to each other as surrogates for authentic virus neutralization. Here, we characterized three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and three pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) neutralization assays and assessed their concordance with authentic virus neutralization.

Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM, and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses. Whereas unexposed individuals had minimal reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins that poorly correlated with reactivity against HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 S2 and N proteins, COVID-19 patient sera had higher correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV responses, suggesting that ',\n",

Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site.

The highly successful RNA-based vaccines have enabled rapid vaccine updates that incorporate mutations from current variants of concern (VOCs). It is therefore important to anticipate future antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this goal, we survey epitope-paratope interfaces of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to map an antigenic space that captures the role of each spike protein residue within the polyclonal antibody response directed against the ACE2-receptor binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD). In particular, the antigenic space map builds on recently published epitope definitions by annotating epitope overlap and orthogonality at the residue level. We employ the antigenic space map as a framework to understand how mutations on nine major variants contribute to each variant's evasion of neutralizing antibodies. Further, we identify constellations of mutations that span the orthogonal epitope regions of the RBD and NTD on the variants with the greatest antibody escape. Finally, we apply the antigenic space map to predict which regions of antigenic space-should they mutate-may be most likely to complementarily augment antibody evasion for the most evasive and transmissible VOCs.\",\n",

We show that even more than one year after infection, about 78% of observed study participants remained seropositive concerning S-IgG antibodies.

We also examined volunteers after either homologous BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination or heterologous AZD1222 prime/mRNA-based booster vaccination. Both the heterologous and the homologous vaccination regimens induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in healthy subjects when compared to subjects after a mild infection, showing the high effectiveness of available vaccines.

       "  'abstract': \"Several vaccines with varying efficacies have been developed and are currently administered globally to minimize the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite having an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with a proofreading activity, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are on the rise periodically. Some of the mutations in these variants, especially mutations on the spike protein, aid the virus in transmission, infectivity and host immune evasion. Further, these mutations also reduce the effectiveness of some of the current vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In the present study, using the available 984,769 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences on the NCBI database from the end of 2019 till 28 July 2021, we have estimated the global prevalence of so-called 'adaptive mutations' and 'mutations identified in the prolonged infections', in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Irrespective of the geographical region, in the case of the adaptive mutations, N501Y (48.38%) was found to be the dominant mutation followed by L452R (17.52%), T478K (14.31%), E484K (4.69%), S477N (3.29%), K417T (1.64%), N439K (0.7%) and S494P (0.7%). Other mutations were found to be less prevalent (less than 0.7%). Since the last two months, there has been a massive increase of L452R and T478K mutations (delta variant) in certain areas. In the case of prolonged infections' mutations (long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections), V483A (0.009%) was found to be dominant followed by Q493R (0.009%), while other mutations were found in less than 0.007% of the studied sequences. The data obtained in this study will aid in the development of better infection control policies, thereby curbing the spread of this virus.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Both the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and emergence of variants of concern have highlighted the need for functional antibody assays to monitor the humoral response over time. Antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are an important component of the neutralizing antibody response. In this work, we report that in a subset of patients-despite a decline in total S-specific antibodies-neutralizing antibody titers remain at a similar level for an average of 98 days in longitudinal sampling of a cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that 100% of seroconverting patients make detectable neutralizing antibody responses which can be quantified by a surrogate viral neutralization test. Examination of sera from ten out of the 59 subjects which received mRNA-based vaccination revealed that both IgG titers and neutralizing activity of sera were higher after vaccination compared to a cohort of 21 SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. One dose was sufficient for the induction of a neutralizing antibody, but two doses were necessary to reach 100% surrogate virus neutralization in subjects irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status. Like the pattern observed after natural infection, the total anti-S antibodies titers declined after the second vaccine dose; however, neutralizing activity remained relatively constant for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. Furthermore, our data indicates that-compared with mRNA vaccination-natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response in unexposed subjects. This work is an important contribution to understanding the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely impacted by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, by comparing the dynamics of the immune response after the natural infection vs. the vaccination, these findings suggest that functional neutralizing antibody tests are more relevant indicators than the presence or absence of binding antibodies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since SARS-CoV-2 appeared in late 2019, many studies on the immune response to COVID-19 have been conducted, but the asymptomatic or light symptom cases were somewhat understudied as respective individuals often did not seek medical help. Here, we analyze the production of the IgG antibodies to viral nucleocapsid (N) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and assess the serum neutralization capabilities in a cohort of patients with different levels of disease severity. In half of light or asymptomatic cases the antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein, which serve as the main target in many modern test systems, were not detected. They were detected in all cases of moderate or severe symptoms, and severe lung lesions correlated with respective higher signals. Antibodies to RBD were present in the absolute majority of samples, with levels being sometimes higher in light symptom cases. We thus suggest that the anti-RBD/anti-N antibody ratio may serve as an indicator of the disease severity. Anti-RBD IgG remained detectable after a year or more since the infection, even with a slight tendency to raise over time, and the respective signal correlated with the serum capacity to inhibit the RBD interaction with the ACE-2 receptor.',\n",

Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, only one recombinant subunit vaccine has been permitted for widespread use. More subunit vaccines for COVID-19 should be developed in the future. The receptor binding domain (RBD), located at the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, contains most of the neutralizing epitopes. However, the immunogenicity of RBD monomers is not strong enough. In this study, we fused the RBD-monomer with a modified Fc fragment of human IgG1 to form an RBD-Fc fusion protein. The recombinant vaccine candidate based on the RBD-Fc protein could induce high levels of IgG and neutralizing antibody in mice, and these could last for at least three months. The secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10 in the RBD-stimulated splenocytes of immunized mice also increased significantly.

However, the precise molecular mechanism of this rare event is yet to be understood. Here, we hypothesize a potential anti-tumor immune response of SARS-CoV-2 and based on a computational approach show that: (i) SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD may bind to the extracellular domains of CD15, CD27, CD45, and CD152 receptors of cHL or FL and may directly inhibit cell proliferation. (ii) Alternately, upon internalization after binding to these CD molecules, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein and ORF3a may bind to gamma-tubulin complex component 3 (GCP3) at its tubulin gamma-1 chain (TUBG1) binding site. (iii) The M protein may also interact with TUBG1, blocking its binding to GCP3. (iv) Both the M and ORF3a proteins may render the GCP2-GCP3 lateral binding where the M protein possibly interacts with GCP2 at its GCP3 binding site and the ORF3a protein to GCP3 at its GCP2 interacting residues. (v) Interactions of the M and ORF3a proteins with these gamma-tubulin ring complex components potentially block the initial process of microtubule nucleation, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

The mAbs to the S-RBD were tested for neutralization of native SARS-CoV-2, with several exhibiting neutralizing activity. The panels of mAbs to the N protein were assessed for cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV N proteins and could be subdivided into sets that showed unique specificity for SARS-CoV-2 N protein, cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV N proteins only, or cross-reactivity to all three coronavirus N proteins tested. Partial mapping of N-reactive mAbs were conducted using truncated fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and revealed near complete coverage of the N protein. Collectively, these sets of mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies can be used to examine structure/function studies for N proteins and to define the surface location of virus neutralizing epitopes on the RBD of the S protein.',\n",

The gland is a primary lymphoid organ responsible for generating mature T cells into CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells, contributing to cellular immunity. Regarding humoral immunity, the thymic plasma cells almost exclusively secrete IgG1 and IgG3, the two main complement-fixing effector IgG subclasses. Deformity in the thymus can lead to inflammatory diseases. Hassall's corpuscles' epithelial lining produces thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which induces differentiation of CDs thymocytes into regulatory T cells within the thymus medulla. Thymic B lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins and immunoregulating hormones, including thymosin. Modulation in T cell and naive T cells decrement due to thymus deformity induce alteration in the secretion of various inflammatory factors, resulting in multiple diseases. Influenza virus activates thymic CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes and a large amount of IFNγ. IFNs limit virus spread, enhance macrophages' phagocytosis, and promote the natural killer cell restriction activity against infected cells. Th2 lymphocytes-produced cytokine IL-4 can bind to antiviral INFγ, decreasing the cell susceptibility and downregulating viral receptors. COVID-19 epitopes (S, M, and N proteins) with ≥90% identity to the SARS-CoV sequence have been predicted. These epitopes trigger immunity for antibodies production. Boosting the immune system by improving thymus function can be a therapeutic strategy for preventing virus-related diseases.

This study compared the performance of a laboratory-developed multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay targeting antibodies to nucleocapsid (N), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) antigens to three commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, and BioRad) and nAb. Paired saliva and plasma samples were collected from 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors >14 days since PCR+ confirmed diagnosis. Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, and Cohen's kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4-92.1% and NPA: 69.2-91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9-100% and NPA: 50.0-84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6-96.6% and NPA: 50.0-100%. Compared to a plasma nAb assay, the multiplex salivary assay PPA ranged from 62.3% (N) and 98.6% (RBD) and NPA ranged from 18.8% (RBD) to 96.9% (S). Combinations of N, RBD, and S and a summary algorithmic index of all three (N/RBD/S) in saliva produced ranges of PPA: 87.6-98.9% and NPA: 50-91.7% with the three EIAs and ranges of PPA: 88.4-98.6% and NPA: 21.9-34.4% with the nAb assay. A multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay demonstrated variable, but comparable performance to three commercially-available plasma EIAs and a nAb assay, and may be a viable alternative to assist in monitoring population-based seroprevalence and vaccine antibody response.\",\n",

In a subset of representative samples, 20.7% and 35.0% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific B- and T-cell responses, respectively. B- and T-cell memory responses were clearly associated with seropositivity, but T-cell responses were also detected in 17.2% of seronegative subjects.\\nAssessment of IgM and T-cell responses may improve population-based estimations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Neutralization capacity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants (D614G mutant, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351) was evaluated using a pseudovirus expressing the corresponding spike (S) protein.

       "  'abstract': 'The global health crisis and economic tolls of COVID-19 necessitate a panoply of strategies to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, few treatment options exist, although neutralizing antibodies against the spike glycoprotein have proven to be effective. Because infection is initiated at the mucosa and propagates mainly at this site throughout the course of the disease, blocking the virus at the mucosal milieu should be effective. However, administration of biologics to the mucosa presents a substantial challenge. Here, we describe bifunctional molecules combining single-domain variable regions that bind to the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) and to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via addition of the ACE2 extracellular domain (ECD). The hypothesis behind this design is that pIgR will transport the molecule from the circulation to the mucosal surface where the ACE ECD would act as a decoy receptor for the nCoV2. The bifunctional molecules bind SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoprotein in vitro and efficiently transcytose across the lung epithelium in human tissue-based analyses. Designs featuring ACE2 tethered to the C-terminus of the Fc do not induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pIgR-expressing cells. These molecules thus represent a potential therapeutic modality for systemic administration of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules to the mucosa.',\n",

A robust serological assay is needed to evaluate vaccine candidates and better understand the epidemiology of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\\nWe used the full-length spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the development of qualitative and quantitative IgG and IgA anti-S enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). A total of 320 sera used for assay development were comprised of pandemic sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected adults (n=51) and pre-pandemic sera (n=269) including sera from endemic human coronavirus infected adults. Reverse cumulative curves and diagnostic test statistics were evaluated to define the optimal serum dilution and OD cutoff value for IgG anti-S and IgA anti-S ELISAs. The IgG and IgA anti-S, and three functional antibodies (ACE-2 receptor blocking antibody, lentipseudovirus-S neutralizing antibody, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody) were measured using additional SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive sera (n=76) and surveillance sera (n=25). Lastly, the IgG and IgA anti-S levels were compared in different demographic groups.\\nThe optimal serum dilution for the qualitative IgG anti-S ELISA was at 1:1024 yielding a 99.6% specificity, 92.2% sensitivity, 92.9% positive predictive value (PPV), and 99.6% negative predictive value (NPV) at a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 5%. The optimal serum dilution for the qualitative IgA anti-S ELISA was at 1:128 yielding a 98.9% specificity, 76.5% sensitivity, 78.3% PPV, and 98.8% NPV at the same seroprevalence.

The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 affected patients with IEIs, in particular those with deficiency in the interferon-mediated activation of the immune response. Initial data suggest that coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines might elicit anti-coronavirus disease 2019-neutralizing antibody responses in some patients with IEI conditions.',\n",

We examined the effect of prior infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants on Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity. We compared participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naive with those either infected with the ancestral D614G virus or infected in the second wave when Beta predominated.

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more infectious than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is concerning. Several of these viral variants have the potential to partially escape neutralizing antibody responses, warranting continued immune-monitoring.\\nWe used a panel of 30 post-mRNA vaccination sera to determine neutralization and RBD and spike binding activity against a number of emerging viral variants. The virus neutralization was determined using authentic SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in an assay format that mimics physiological conditions.\\nWe tested seven currently circulating viral variants of concern/interest, including the three Iota sublineages, Alpha (E484K), Beta, Delta and Lambda in neutralization assays. We found only small decreases in neutralization against Iota and Delta. The reduction was stronger against a sub-variant of Lambda, followed by Beta and Alpha (E484K). Lambda is currently circulating in parts of Latin America and was detected in Germany, the US and Israel. Of note, reduction in a receptor binding domain and spike binding assay that also included Gamma, Kappa and A.23.1 was negligible.\\nTaken together, these findings suggest that mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may remain effective against these viral variants of concern/interest and that spike binding antibody tests likely retain specificity in the face of evolving SARS-CoV-2 diversity.\\nThis work is part of the PARIS/SPARTA studies funded by the NIAID Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVIC) contract 75N93019C00051.

Vaccination therapies use the same Spike sequence or protein to boost host immune response as a protective mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, cases of thrombotic events are reported following vaccination. Although vaccines are generally considered safe, due to genetic heterogeneity, age, or the presence of comorbidities in the population worldwide, the prediction of severe adverse outcome in patients remains a challenge. To elucidate Spike proteins underlying patient-specific-vascular thrombosis, the human microcirculation environment is recapitulated using a novel microfluidic platform coated with human endothelial cells and exposed to patient specific whole blood. Here, the blood coagulation effect is tested after exposure to Spike protein in nanoparticles and Spike variant D614G in viral vectors and the results are corroborated using live SARS-CoV-2.

Their defects in one or more essential functions for viral replication, particle assembly, or dissemination make them highly safe as vaccines. We previously showed that the deletion of the envelope (E) gene from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) produces a replication-competent propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-ΔE). Evaluation of this replicon in mice expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the virus receptor, showed that the single deletion of the E gene generated an attenuated mutant. The combined deletion of the E gene with accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 resulted in a highly attenuated propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E]). This RNA replicon induced sterilizing immunity in mice after challenge with a lethal dose of a virulent MERS-CoV, as no histopathological damage or infectious virus was detected in the lungs of challenged mice. The four mutants lacking the E gene were genetically stable, did not recombine with the E gene provided in trans during their passage in cell culture, and showed a propagation-defective phenotype in vivo. In addition, immunization with MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E] induced significant levels of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that MERS-CoV RNA replicons are highly safe and promising vaccine candidates.',\n",

BCEPS implements various machine learning models trained on a dataset including 555 linearized conformational B cell epitopes that were mined from antibody-antigen protein structures. The best performing model, based on a support vector machine, reached an accuracy of 75.38% ± 5.02. In an independent dataset consisting of B cell epitopes retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), this model achieved an accuracy of 67.05%. In BCEPS, predicted epitopes can be ranked according to properties such as flexibility, accessibility and hydrophilicity, and with regard to immunogenicity, as judged by their predicted presentation by MHC II molecules. BCEPS also detects if predicted epitopes are located in ectodomains of membrane proteins and if they possess N-glycosylation sites hindering antibody recognition.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into S1 and S2, in which the S1 subunit has the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, whereas nucleocapsid is an ideal target for viral antigen-based detection. In this study, we designed plasmids, pcDNA3.1/S1 and pcDNA3.1/N, and optimized their expression of the recombinant S1 and N proteins from SARS-CoV-2 in a mammalian system. The RBD was used as a control. The antigens were successfully purified from Expi293 cells, with high yields of the S1, N, and RBD proteins.

These bacteria express unusually large numbers of antigens mimicking human blood antigens, as do both SARS-CoV-2 and adenoviruses. Bacteria mimic cardiolipin, prothrombin, albumin, and platelet factor 4 (PF4). SARS-CoV-2 mimics complement factors, Rh antigens, platelet phosphodiesterases, Factors IX and X, von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and VWF protease ADAMTS13. Adenoviruses mimic prothrombin and platelet factor 4. Bacterial prophylaxis, avoidance of vaccinating bacterially infected individuals, and antigen deletion for vaccines may reduce coagulopathy risk.

       "  'abstract': 'Receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion are essential for the establishment of successful infection by SARS-CoV-2. Halting these steps can cure COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse events when administrated with 10 times the effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to the ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the receptor binding domain, possibly interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results suggest that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19.',\n",

High-throughput, highly flexible methods for characterization are of great benefit to the development of liposomes featuring surface proteins. DNA-directed patterning is one such method that offers versatility in immobilizing and segregating lipid-based nanoparticles for subsequent analysis. Here, oligonucleotides are selectively conjugated onto a glass substrate and then hybridized to complementary oligonucleotides tagged to liposomes, patterning them with great control and precision. The power of DNA-directed patterning is demonstrated by characterizing a novel recapitulative lipid-based nanoparticle model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-S-liposomes-that presents the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on its surface. Patterning a mixture of S-liposomes and liposomes that display the tetraspanin CD63 to discrete regions of a substrate shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) specifically binds to S-liposomes. Subsequent introduction of S-liposomes to ACE2-expressing cells tests the biological function of S-liposomes and shows agreement with DNA-directed patterning-based assays. Finally, multiplexed patterning of S-liposomes verifies the performance of commercially available neutralizing antibodies against the two S variants. Overall, DNA-directed patterning enables a wide variety of custom assays for the characterization of any lipid-based nanoparticle.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Blood clots are a central feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and can culminate in pulmonary embolism, stroke, and sudden death. However, it is not known how abnormal blood clots form in COVID-19 or why they occur even in asymptomatic and convalescent patients. Here we report that the Spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen and induces structurally abnormal blood clots with heightened proinflammatory activity. SARS-CoV-2 Spike virions enhanced fibrin-mediated microglia activation and induced fibrinogen-dependent lung pathology. COVID-19 patients had fibrin autoantibodies that persisted long after acute infection. Monoclonal antibody 5B8, targeting the cryptic inflammatory fibrin epitope, inhibited thromboinflammation. Our results reveal a procoagulant role for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and propose fibrin-targeting interventions as a treatment for thromboinflammation in COVID-19.\\nSARS-CoV-2 spike induces structurally abnormal blood clots and thromboinflammation neutralized by a fibrin-targeting antibody.',\n",

Among those tests, a test for the neutralizing ability of an antibody is crucial for assessment of population immunity gained through vaccination, and to test therapeutic value of antibodies made to counter the infections. Here, we report a sensitive technique to detect the relative neutralizing strength of various antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used bright, photostable, background-free, fluorescent upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a phantom virion. A glass bottom plate coated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein imitates the target cells. When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the particles would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a neutralizing antibody can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated substrate. A prototype system consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope was used to quantify particle attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of this assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2 {\\\\mu}g/ml. This is to be compared to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially available kits.',\n",

However, in the absence of efficacious prophylactic medications and few treatments for this infection, the induction of a fast and robust protective immunity is required for effective disease control, not only to prevent the disease but also the infection and shedding/transmission. The objective of our study was to analyze the level of specific humoral and cellular T-cell responses against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced by two mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), but also how long it takes after vaccination to induce these protective humoral and cellular immune responses.\\nWe studied in 40 healthy (not previously infected) volunteers vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines the presence of spike-specific IgG antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells at 3, 7 and 14 days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. The specific T-cell response was analyzed stimulating fresh whole blood from vaccinated volunteers with SARS-CoV-2 peptides and measuring the release of cytokines secreted by T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 stimulation.\\nOur results indicate that the immunization capacity of both vaccines is comparable. However, although both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines can induce early B-cell and T-cell responses, these vaccine-mediated immune responses do not reach their maximum values until 14 days after completing the vaccination schedule.\\nThis refractory period in the induction of specific immunity observed after completing the vaccination could constitute a window of higher infection risk, which could explain some emerging cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated people.',\n",

Anti-Spike IgG were detectable before vaccination in 4 out 7 CVID previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were boosted in six out of seven patients by the subsequent immunization raising higher levels than patients naïve to infection. While HD generated Spike-specific memory B-cells, and RBD-specific B-cells, CVID generated Spike-specific atypical B-cells, while RBD-specific B-cells were undetectable in all patients, indicating the incapability to generate this new specificity. Specific T-cell responses were evident in all HD and defective in 30% of CVID.

Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants, we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains, including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), B.1.429 (epsilon), B.1.526 (iota), A.23.1, and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies.

Most SARS-CoV-2 studies characterize antibody responses in plasma/sera. While reliable and broadly used, these samples pose several logistical restrictions, such as requiring venipuncture for collection and a cold chain for transportation and storage. Dried blood spots (DBS) overcome these barriers as they can be self-collected by fingerstick and mailed and stored at ambient temperature. Here, we evaluate the suitability of DBS for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by comparing several antibody responses between paired plasma and DBS from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We found that DBS not only reflected plasma antibody binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and epitope profiles using phage display, but also yielded SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers that highly correlated with paired plasma. Neutralization measurement was further streamlined by adapting assays to a high-throughput 384-well format.

Samples (n = 9806) were collected over a month-long period (3 December 2020-6 January 2021) from donors aged 16-88 years. The sample population was geographically spread, covering 16 of 20 district health board regions. A series of Spike-based immunoassays were utilised, and the serological testing algorithm was optimised for specificity given New Zealand is a low prevalence setting. Eighteen samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, six of which were retrospectively matched to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases. A further four were from donors that travelled to settings with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, suggesting likely infection outside New Zealand. The remaining eight seropositive samples were from seven different district health regions for a true seroprevalence estimate, adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity, of 0.103% (95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.12%).

       "  'abstract': 'It is hypothesized that several comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Cardiovascular disease including hypertension was shown to play a critical role in the severity of COVID-19 infection by affecting the survival of patients with COVID-19. Hypertension and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are involved in increasing vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (ED), and both processes are instrumental in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the target receptor that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry to the cell. This led to speculations that major renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, such as angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might affect the course of the disease, since their administration enhances angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 expression. An increase in ACE2 activity could reduce angiotensin II concentration in the lungs and mitigate virus-driven lung injury. This could also be associated with a reduction in blood coagulation, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; of note, COVID-19 is now regarded as a disorder of blood clotting. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the effect of targeting ACE2 as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 driven injury, and in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms by reversing SARS-CoV-2-induced excessive coagulation and fatalities. Ongoing therapeutic strategies that include recombinant human ACE2 and anti-spike monoclonal antibodies are essential for future clinical practice in order to better understand the effect of targeting ED in COVID-19.',\n",

A total of 1053 healthcare workers who were initially seronegative (COV2T® SARS-CoV-2 Total Siemens, USA) and vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study. Quantitative IgG antibodies (ADVIA Centaur® SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens, USA) were investigated 28 days after the first vaccine (n= 939) and the second vaccine (n= 771). In addition, neutralizing antibodies were evaluated via \"enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\" test (ACE2-RBD Neutralization Assay, Dia-Pro, Italy) 28 days after the first vaccine. Antibody response of the vaccine was evaluated statistically by univariate (Chi-square, Fisher\\'s exact test, Student\\'s t test, Mann-Whitney U, one-way ANOVA and Kruskall Wallis ANOVA tests) analysis and linear regression models. The consistency between quantitative IgG test and neutralizing antibody test was also evaluated in blood samples taken 28 days after second vaccination. Statistical analysis was determined in logarithmically transformed data with statistical analysis with SPSS 23.0 and Stata, and type 1 error level was accepted as 0.05. At least one side effect was reported by 31.3% and 26.8% of the participants after the first and second vaccine, respectively. The most frequent side effect was pain at the injection site with a frequency of 20.4% vs 21.7%. The frequency of applying to a health center due to side effects was 1.0% after the first vaccine and 0.8% after the second vaccine. The percentage of those who produced sufficient quantitative IgG was found as 25.3% (95% CI= 22.5-28.1) 28 days after the first vaccine and 97.9% (95% CI= 96.91- 98.93) after the second vaccine. Neutralizing test antibody positivity was found as 97.7% 28 days after the second vaccine. In univariate analysis, the characteristics that significantly increased the quantitative IgG response against inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were young age (p<0.01), female gender (p<0.01), being a non smoker (p<0.001), not having a chronic disease (p= 0.019), having had the flu vaccine this year (p= 0.012), not being overweight or obese (p= 0.020), and having a SARS-CoV2 infection prior to vaccination (p<0.001). In addition, allied health personnel showed significantly lower antibody responses than the other workers (p<0.001). Multiple linear regression models revealed that, female gender, younger age, smoking and previous COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test positivity significantly affected the quantitative IgG response after vaccination. A 99% agreement was found between the ELISA-based neutralizing antibody test and the quantitative IgG test (Kappa p= 0.783) performed on the 28th day after the second vaccination. CoronaVac® provides adequate antibody response in 25% of healthcare workers aged 18-64, after 28 days from a single vaccine, and 97% after 28 days from the second vaccine. Antibody response was significantly higher in younger ages, women, non-smokers, and those who had previously encountered SARS-CoV-2. Phase 3 and phase 4 results are needed to Show effectiveness of this vaccine in real life.',\n",

In this study, we combine atomistic simulations with the ensemble-based mutational profiling of binding for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexes with a wide range of nanobodies to identify dynamic and binding affinity fingerprints and characterize the energetic determinants of nanobody-escaping mutations. Using an in silico mutational profiling approach for probing the protein stability and binding, we examine dynamics and energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with single nanobodies Nb6 and Nb20, VHH E, a pair combination VHH E + U, a biparatopic nanobody VHH VE, and a combination of the CC12.3 antibody and VHH V/W nanobodies. This study characterizes the binding energy hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 protein and complexes with nanobodies providing a quantitative analysis of the effects of circulating variants and escaping mutations on binding that is consistent with a broad range of biochemical experiments. The results suggest that mutational escape may be controlled through structurally adaptable binding hotspots in the receptor-accessible binding epitope that are dynamically coupled to the stability centers in the distant binding epitope targeted by VHH U/V/W nanobodies. This study offers a plausible mechanism in which through cooperative dynamic changes, nanobody combinations and biparatopic nanobodies can elicit the increased binding affinity response and yield resilience to common escape mutants.',\n",

Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize two protective anti-SARS-CoV-2 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in complex with the spike protein, revealing similarities between epitopes targeted by human and murine B cells. The more neutralizing mAb, 2B04, binds the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and competes with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By contrast, 2H04 binds adjacent to the RBM and does not compete for ACE2 binding. Naturally occurring sequence variants of SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding neutralization escape variants selected in\\xa0vitro map to our structurally defined epitopes, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might evade therapeutic antibodies with a limited set of mutations, underscoring the importance of combination mAb therapeutics.

Analyses of convalescent sera provide unique insights into antibody longevity and cross-neutralizing activity induced by variant spike proteins, which are putative vaccine candidates. Using sera from 38 individuals infected in wave 1, we show that cross-neutralizing activity can be detected up to 305 days pos onset of symptoms, although sera were less potent against B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B1.351 (Beta). Over time, despite a reduction in overall neutralization activity, differences in sera neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Beta variants decreased, which suggests that continued antibody maturation improves tolerance to spike mutations. We also compared the cross-neutralizing activity of wave 1 sera with sera from individuals infected with the Alpha, the Beta or the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants up to 79 days post onset of symptoms. While these sera neutralize the infecting VOC and parental virus to similar levels, cross-neutralization of different SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages is reduced.

       "  'abstract': 'The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum are found unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here, it has been shown that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising\\xa0CpG/Alum\\xa0adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel\\xa0elicited potent\\xa0anti-RBD and\\xa0anti-spike\\xa0antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems.

       "  'abstract': 'The receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants of SARS-CoV-2 could impair antibody-mediated neutralization of the virus by host immunity; thus, prospective surveillance of antibody escape mutants and understanding the evolution of RBD are urgently needed.\\nUsing the single B cell cloning technology, we isolated and characterized 93 RBD-specific antibodies from the memory B cells of four COVID-19 convalescent individuals in the early stage of the pandemic. Then, global RBD alanine scanning with a panel of 19 selected neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including several broadly reactive NAbs, was performed. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of single natural mutation or co-mutations of concern at key positions of RBD on the neutralization escape and ACE2 binding function by recombinant proteins and pseudoviruses.\\nThirty-three amino acid positions within four independent antigenic sites (1 to 4) of RBD were identified as valuable indicators of antigenic changes in the RBD. The comprehensive escape mutation map not only confirms the widely circulating strains carrying important immune escape RBD mutations such as K417N, E484K, and L452R, but also facilitates the discovery of new immune escape-enabling mutations such as F486L, N450K, F490S, and R346S. Of note, these escape mutations could not affect the ACE2 binding affinity of RBD, among which L452R even enhanced binding. Furthermore, we showed that RBD co-mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y present in B.1.351 appear more resistant to NAbs and human convalescent plasma from the\\xa0early stage of the pandemic, possibly due to an additive effect. Conversely, double mutations E484Q and L452R present in B.1.617.1 variant show partial antibody evasion with no evidence for an additive effect.\\nOur study provides a global view of the determinants for neutralizing antibody recognition, antigenic conservation, and RBD conformation. The in-depth escape maps may have value for prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 immune escape variants. Special attention should be paid to the accumulation of co-mutations at distinct major antigenic sites.

The reference test for the anti-spike neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) ability to counteract the viral infection is the virus neutralization test (VNT). Great interest is developing on reliable serological assays allowing antibodies concentration and antibody protective titer correlation. The aim of our study was to detect nAbs serum levels in paucisymptomatic, symptomatic and vaccinated subjects, to find a cut-off value able to protect from virus infection. nAbs serum levels were detected by a competitive automated immunoassay, in association to VNT with the SARS-CoV-2 original and British variant strains. The median nAbs concentrations were: 281.3 BAU/ml for paucisymptomatics; 769.4 BAU/ml for symptomatics; 351.65 BAU/ml for the vaccinated cohort; 983 BAU/ml considering only the second dose vaccinated individuals. The original strain VNT analysis showed 1:80 median neutralization titers in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated subjects; 1:160 in symptomatic patients; 1:160 in the second dose groups. The British variant VNT analysis showed lower neutralization titers in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated groups (1:40); the same titer in symptomatic patients (1:160); the second dose group confirmed the original strain titer (1:160). In conclusion, our data showed optimal correlations with a proportional increase between neutralizing activity and antibody concentration, making nAbs detection a good alternative to virus neutralization assays, difficult to carry out in routine laboratories. Finally, ROC curve analysis established a cut-off of 408.6 BAU/ml to identify subjects with a low risk of infection.',\n",

Cross-reactive antibody responses have been seen in previous variants of SARS and SARS-CoV-2, but little is known about the cross reactivity with other similar RNA viruses like HIV-1. In the present study, we examined the reactivity the SARS-CoV-2 directed antibodies, via spike, immunized mice sera and demonstrated whether they conferred any cross-reactive neutralization against HIV-1. Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 spike immunized mice antibodies cross-react with the HIV-1 Env protein. Cross-neutralization among the two viruses is uncommon, suggesting the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes amongst the two viruses. Our results indicate, that SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody cross reactivity is targeted towards the gp41 region of the HIV-1 Env (gp160) protein. Overall, our investigation not only answers a crucial question about the understanding of cross-reactive epitopes of antibodies generated in different viral infections, but also provides critical evidence for developing vaccine immunogens and novel treatment strategies with enhanced efficacy capable of recognising diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features.',\n",

IgG and IgM antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, serum-neutralizing activity, plasma cytokine levels, and the frequency of circulating Follicular T helper cells (cTfh) and plasmablasts were analyzed by conventional methods.\\nFifty-eight percent of the children in the acute phase of infection had no detectable antibodies at the time of sampling while a seronegative status was found in 25% and 12% of convalescent and MIS-C children, respectively. When children in the acute phase of the infection were stratified according disease severity, we found that contrasting with the response of children with asymptomatic, mild and moderate disease, children with severe COVID-19 did not develop any detectable response. A defective antibody response was also observed in the convalescent cohort for children with severe disease at the time of admission. This poor antibody response was associated to both, a low frequency of cTfh and a high plasma concentration of inflammatory cytokines.\\nA weak and delayed kinetic of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 together with a systemic pro-inflammatory profile characterize pediatric severe COVID-19.

       "  'abstract': 'The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the disease COVID-19 can lead to serious symptoms, such as severe pneumonia, in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. While vaccines are now available, they do not work for everyone and therapeutic drugs are still needed, particularly for treating life-threatening conditions. Here, we showed nasal delivery of a new, unmodified camelid single-domain antibody (VHH), termed K-874A, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 titers in infected lungs of Syrian hamsters without causing weight loss and cytokine induction. In vitro studies demonstrated that K-874A neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in both VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and human lung-derived alveolar organoid cells. Unlike other drug candidates, K-874A blocks viral membrane fusion rather than viral attachment. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed K-874A bound between the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain of the virus S protein. Further, infected cells treated with K-874A produced fewer virus progeny that were less infective. We propose that direct administration of K-874A to the lung could be a new treatment for preventing the reinfection of amplified virus in COVID-19 patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has cost millions of lives and tremendous social/financial loss. The virus continues to evolve and mutate. In particular, the recently emerged \"UK\", \"South Africa\", and Delta variants show higher infectivity and spreading speed. Thus, the relationship between the mutations of certain amino acids and the spreading speed of the virus is a problem of great importance. In this respect, understanding the mutational mechanism is crucial for surveillance and prediction of future mutations as well as antibody/vaccine development. In this work, we used a coarse-grained model (that was used previously in predicting the importance of mutations of N501) to calculate the free energy change of various types of single-site or combined-site mutations. This was done for the UK, South Africa, and Delta mutants. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the binding affinity changes for mutations at different spike protein domains of SARS-CoV-2 and provided the energy basis for the resistance of the E484 mutant to the antibody m396. Other potential mutation sites were also predicted. Furthermore, the in silico predictions were assessed by functional experiments. The results establish that the faster spreading of recently observed mutants is strongly correlated with the binding-affinity enhancement between virus and human receptor as well as with the reduction of the binding to the m396 antibody. Significantly, the current approach offers a way to predict new variants and to assess the effectiveness of different antibodies toward such variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The newly emerging Kappa, Delta, and Lambda SARS-CoV-2 variants are worrisome, characterized with the double mutations E484Q/L452R, T478K/L452R, and F490S/L452Q, respectively, in their receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the spike proteins. As revealed in crystal structures, most of these residues (e.g., 452 and 484 in RBDs) are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, these mutations might not significantly affect RBD's binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without knowing the molecular mechanism, these successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) may be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, here, we show that the E484Q/L452R mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between the RBD of the Kappa variant and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab), which was efficacious for neutralizing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. To verify simulation results, we further carried out experiments with both pseudovirions- and live virus-based neutralization assays and demonstrated that LY-CoV555 completely lost neutralizing activity against the L452R/E484Q mutant. Similarly, we show that mutations in the Delta and Lambda variants can also destabilize the RBD's binding with LY-CoV555. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how these variants evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precise mixing of antibodies can be achieved as a cocktail treatment for patients infected with these variants.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerging of coronavirus, continues to infect humans in the absence of a viable treatment. Neutralizing antibodies that disrupt the interaction of RBD and ACE2 has been under the spotlight as a way of developing the COVID-19 treatment. Some animals, such as llamas, manufacture heavy-chain antibodies that have a single variable domain (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH/VL) as opposed to typical antibodies. Nanobodies are antigen-specific, single-domain, changeable segments of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies that are recombinantly produced. These types of antibodies exhibit a wide range of strong physical and chemical properties, like high solubility, and stability. The VHH's high-affinity attachment to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) allowed the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. To tackle COVID-19, some nanobodies are being developed against SARS-CoV-2, some of which have been recently included in clinical trials. Nanobody therapy may be useful in managing the COVID-19 pandemic as a potent and low-cost treatment. This paper describes the application of nanobodies as a new class of recombinant antibodies in COVID-19 treatment.\",\n",

Using this stringent transgenic model, we demonstrated that a non-integrative lentiviral vector, encoding for the spike glycoprotein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2, used in intramuscular prime and intranasal boost elicits sterilizing protection of lung and brain against both the ancestral virus, and the Gamma (P.1) variant of concern, which carries multiple vaccine escape mutations. Beyond induction of strong neutralizing antibodies, the mechanism underlying this broad protection spectrum involves a robust protective T-cell immunity, unaffected by the recent mutations accumulated in the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential escape mutations by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue.\\nIndividuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination.\\nThe finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.\\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI138709 (PI Overbaugh) and AI146028 (PI Matsen).

Early in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Argentinean Biobank of Infectious Diseases (BBEI) initiated the COVID19 collection and started its characterization. Blood samples from subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection either admitted to health institutions or outpatients, were enrolled. Highly exposed seronegative individuals, were also enrolled. Longitudinal samples were obtained in a subset of donors, including persons who donated plasma for therapeutic purposes (plasma donors). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels, IgG titers and IgG viral neutralization capacity were determined. Out of 825 donors, 57.1% were females and median age was 41 years (IQR 32-53 years). Donors were segregated as acute or convalescent donors, and mild versus moderate/severe disease donors. Seventy-eight percent showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Specific IgM and IgG showed comparable positivity rates in acute donors. IgM detectability rate declined in convalescent donors while IgG detectability remained elevated in early (74,8%) and late (83%) convalescent donors. Among donors with follow-up samples, IgG levels seemed to decline more rapidly in plasma donors. IgG levels were higher with age, disease severity, number of symptoms, and more durable in moderate/severe disease donors. Levels and titers of anti-spike/RBD IgG strongly correlated with neutralization activity against WT virus. The BBEI-COVID19 collection serves a dual role in this SARS-CoV-2 global crisis.

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is vaccinated. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.\",\n",

The Fc moiety is designed to enhance immunogenicity by increasing uptake via Fc-receptors (FcγR) on Ag-presenting cells (APCs) and prolonging exposure due to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling.

       "  'abstract': 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a devastating effect on public health and the world economy. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, with the majority of transmission occurring from close contact with presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic carriers. Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been considerable progress in the management of COVID-19 with the development of novel therapeutics and highly efficacious vaccines that have led to favorable patient outcomes and has limited the spread of the virus. A variety of therapeutic options are currently available in the management of COVID-19, including antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents. However, the therapeutic potential and clinical use of these drugs are limited and are specific to the stage of the illness. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness occurs in two distinct phases, an early stage characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication followed by a late phase characterized by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and activation of the coagulation system resulting in a prothrombotic state. Antiviral therapy and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective if used during the early phase of the illness. Immunomodulating therapies, either alone or in combination with antiviral and antibody-based therapies, may be more effective when used in the later stage to combat the cytokine-mediated hyperinflammatory state that causes severe illness.[1] Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection and severe disease. However, individuals aged ≥60 years and with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the CDC during January 22\\xa0to May 30, 2020.[2]\\xa0 A promising approach to address the COVID-19 associated mortality and preventing the increased utilization of healthcare resources is by terminating the progression of viral replication preventing the progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19, which causes severe illness in high-risk nonhospitalized patients. Initially, the focus of treatment was directed mainly towards hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness. However, the clinical focus throughout the pandemic expanded towards combatting the illness early on by reducing the viral load in patients with early disease, thus attempting to halt the disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 have yielded positive in vitro results.[3][4]\\xa0They are considered a promising approach in managing nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins developed from a single cell lineage that demonstrate a high affinity for their target cell. Monoclonal antibodies were first developed by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 using hybridoma technology.[5] Since then, significant progress has been made in the molecular engineering world that has enabled the establishment of monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapies in various neoplastic conditions, autoimmune, post-transplant immunosuppression, and infectious diseases.[6]\\xa0When used as antiviral therapies, neutralizing antibodies play an indispensable part in achieving passive antiviral immunity and are also instrumental in preventing or regulating many viral illnesses. Over the years, passive immunization against many viral diseases was achieved by administering polyclonal sera obtained from convalescent human donors or animals. However, polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by monoclonal antibodies because they demonstrate a favorable safety profile and target specificity when used in different viral diseases.[7]\\xa0Palivizumab was the first antiviral monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants.[8]\\xa0 Over the years, significant developments in antibody engineering, improved understanding of the biology of viruses, and the direct and indirect effect of monoclonal antibodies on viral infections has resulted in many novel monoclonal antibodies. Like other antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, when used as antiviral agents, are also susceptible to developing resistance as a result of alterations in the viral genome which can alter the pathogenic potential of the virus resulting in the emergence of viral escape mutants, which may render the virus-resistant to a specific monoclonal antibody. To counter this viral escape phenomenon, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as antibody cocktails, have been proposed with the rationale that combining two specific monoclonal antibodies that complement each other can prevent neutralization escape by targeting multiple viral epitopes. Various monoclonal antibodies are currently in development or clinical trials to treat COVID-19. Currently, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for clinical use of casirivimab plus imdevimab as combination therapy,\\xa0bamlanivimab plus etesivimab as combination therapy, or sotrovimab monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are at high risk of developing severe disease. Additionally, the FDA has granted EUAs authorizing the use of casirivimab plus imdevimab and bamlanivimab plus etesivimab for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of COVID-19 in specific adult and pediatric individuals. This review article briefly discusses the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, indications for the use of monoclonal antibody therapy, and evaluating and referring patients for monoclonal antibody therapy in the emergency department if they present with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and are at high risk of developing severe illness.',\n",

Furthermore, rural communities have always been especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, and the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic exposed some\\xa0fragilities in our national supply chain.\\xa0A nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing devices (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs, reagents, and test kits), and respiratory ventilators plagued initial efforts to combat COVID-19.[2] The acute shortage of testing devices made it neither practical nor beneficial to promote universal screening for COVID-19 in rural areas. Perhaps even more disparate, as a country,\\xa0the USA is experiencing a shortage of trained nurses, allied health providers, and physicians, and\\xa0rural communities are often the most challenged in providing adequate numbers of health care professionals and, in particular, sub-specialist physicians to care for their residents.[3] SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, with most transmission occurring from close contact with pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic carriers. Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), considerable progress has been made in managing COVID-19 with the development of novel therapeutics and efficacious vaccines that have led to favorable patient outcomes and has helped limit the spread of the virus. A variety of therapeutic options are currently available in the management of COVID-19, including antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents. However, the therapeutic potential and clinical use of these drugs are limited and are specific to the stage of the illness. Further, rural areas have limited resources to provide access to monoclonal antibody therapy. Some strategies to provide options for rural healthcare systems will be discussed here. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness occurs in two distinct phases, an early stage characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication followed by a late phase characterized by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and activation of the coagulation system resulting in a prothrombotic state. Antiviral therapy and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective if used during the early phase of the illness. Immunomodulating therapies, either alone or in combination with antiviral and antibody-based therapies, may be more effective when used in the later stage to combat the cytokine-mediated hyperinflammatory state that causes severe illness.[4] Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection and severe disease. However, as noted previously, high-risk individuals are those aged ≥60 years and with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the CDC during January 22\\xa0to May 30, 2020.[5]\\xa0 An encouraging approach to address the COVID-19 associated mortality and preventing the increased utilization of healthcare resources is by terminating the progression of viral replication preventing the progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19, which causes severe illness in high-risk non-hospitalized patients. Initially, the focus of treatment was directed mainly towards hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness. However, the clinical focus over the course of the pandemic expanded towards combatting the illness early on by reducing the viral load in patients with early disease, thus attempting to halt the disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 have yielded positive in vitro results.[6][7]\\xa0They are considered a promising approach in managing non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins developed from a single cell lineage that demonstrate a high affinity for their target cell. Monoclonal antibodies were first developed by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 using hybridoma technology.[8]\\xa0Since then, research has made significant progress in the molecular engineering world that has enabled the establishment of monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapies in various neoplastic conditions, autoimmune, post-transplant immunosuppression, and infectious diseases.[9]\\xa0When used as antiviral therapies, neutralizing antibodies play an indispensable part in achieving passive antiviral immunity and are also instrumental in preventing or regulating many viral illnesses. Over the years, passive immunization against many viral diseases was achieved by administering polyclonal sera obtained from convalescent human donors or animals. However, polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by monoclonal antibodies by virtue of their favorable safety profile and target specificity when used in different viral diseases.[10]\\xa0Palivizumab was the first antiviral monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants.[11]\\xa0 Over the years, significant developments in antibody engineering, improved understanding of the biology of viruses, and the direct and indirect effect of monoclonal antibodies on viral infections have resulted in the development of many novel monoclonal antibodies. Like other antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, when used as antiviral agents, are also susceptible to developing resistance as a result of alterations in the viral genome which can alter the pathogenic potential of the virus resulting in the emergence of viral escape mutants, which may render the virus-resistant to a specific monoclonal antibody. To counter this viral escape phenomenon, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as antibody cocktails, have been proposed with the rationale that combining two specific monoclonal antibodies that complement each other can prevent neutralization escape by targeting multiple viral epitopes. Various monoclonal antibodies are currently in development or clinical trials to treat COVID-19. The FDA has currently granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for clinical use of casirivimab plus imdevimab,\\xa0bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, both as\\xa0combination therapy, or sotrovimab as monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Additionally, the FDA has granted EUAs authorizing the use of casirivimab plus imdevimab and bamlanivimab plus etesevimab for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of COVID-19 in certain adult and pediatric individuals.',\n",

Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro. In addition, three antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies, due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition, and formatting flexibility, should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.',\n",

We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4',\n",

Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection.

Also, from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, concern has been raised about the potential for Fcγ receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. In this study, plaque reduction neutralization assays demonstrated that mAb 1741-LALA neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 strains B.1.351, D614 and D614G. MAbs S1D2-hIgG1 and S1D2-LALA mutant (STI-1499-LALA) did not neutralize B.1.351, but did neutralize SARS-CoV-2 strains D614 and D614G. LALA mutations did not result in substantial differences in neutralizing abilities between clones S1D2-hIgG1 vs STI-1499-LALA. S1D2-hIgG1, STI-1499-LALA, and convalescent plasma showed minimal ability to induce ADE in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Further, no differences in pharmacokinetic clearance of S1D2-hIgG1 vs STI-1499-LALA were observed in mice expressing human FcRn. These findings confirm that SARS-CoV-2 has already escaped some mAbs, and identify a mAb candidate that may neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. They also suggest that risk of ADE in macrophages may be low with SARS-CoV-2 D614, and LALA Fc change impacts neither viral neutralization nor Ab clearance.',\n",

This review summarizes current knowledge and new discoveries about human milk and mucosal immunity.\\nNew data suggest that certain microbes in maternal milk may seed and shape the infant gut microbiota, which play a key role in regulating gut barrier integrity and training the developing immune system. Human milk oligosaccharides, best known for their prebiotic functions, have now been shown to directly modulate gene expression in mast and goblet cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Epidemiologic data show a reduced risk of peanut sensitization among infants breastfed by peanut-consuming mothers, suggesting a role for milk-borne food antigens in tolerance development. Cross-fostering experiments in mice suggest the soluble Toll-like receptor 2, found in human milk, may be critical in this process. Finally, interest in human milk antibodies surged during the pandemic with the identification of neutralizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies in maternal milk following both natural infection and vaccination.\\nHuman milk provides critical immune protection and stimulation to breastfed infants.

Convalescent volunteers were also investigated to evaluate adaptive immunity induced by live virus. Although both vaccines induced antibody- and T cell-mediated immune responses, our analysis revealed significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the two types of challenges. The BBIBP-CorV vaccine elicited antireceptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG, as well as anti-spike protein (S) IgG and IgA antibodies in healthy individuals, the levels of which were much lower than after BNT162b2 vaccination but still higher than in the convalescent patients. The cumulative IFNγ-positive T cell response, however, was only twofold higher in participants injected with BNT162b2 compared to those who were primed and boosted with BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Moreover, the inactivated virus vaccine induced T cell response that targets not only the S but also the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, whereas the mRNA vaccine was able to elicit a much narrower response that targets the S protein epitopes only. Thus, the pattern of BBIBP-CorV-induced T cell response in virus-naive participants was similar to the cell-mediated anti-SARS-CoV-2 response observed in convalescent patients. Based on these data, we can conclude that the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine is immunologically effective. However, the duration of BBIBP-CorV-induced integrated, antibody, and T cell-mediated, immune responses needs further investigation.',\n",

These mutations have implications for effectiveness of the vaccines and neutralizing antibodies in immunized subjects and those previously infected with the virus and are thought to facilitate the viral invasion into host cells and help the virus evade the host immune system. Widespread dissemination of the viral variants may cause severe clinical consequences, lengthy hospitalizations, and unfavorable prognoses.

       "  'abstract': 'During the past two years, the world has been ravaged by a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Acquired mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affecting virus infectivity and/or immunogenicity have led to a number of novel strains with higher transmissibility compared to the original Wuhan strain. Mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been extensively studied in this context. However, mutations and deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) located adjacent to the RBD are less studied. Many of these are found within certain β sheet-linking loops, which are surprisingly long in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and other related β coronaviruses. Here, we perform a structural and epidemiological study of novel strains carrying mutations and deletions within these loops. We identify short and long-distance interactions that stabilize the NTD loops of the spike protein and form a critical epitope that is essential for the recognition by a wide variety of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent plasma. Among the different mutations/deletions found in these loops, Ala 67 and Asp 80 mutations as well as His 69/Val 70 and Tyr 144 deletions have been identified in different fast-spreading strains. Similarly, deletions in amino acids 241-243 and 246-252 have been found to affect the network of NTD loops in strains with high transmissibility. Our structural findings provide insight regarding the role of these mutations/deletions in altering the epitope structure and thus affecting the immunoreactivity of the NTD region of spike protein.',\n",

The RBD of the spike protein was considered to be a safe and effective candidate antigen. However, the low immunogenicity limited its application in vaccine development. Herein, we designed and obtained an RBD heptamer (mHla-RBD) based on a carrier protein-aided assembly strategy. The molecular weight of mHla-RBD is up to 450 kDa, approximately 10 times higher than that of the RBD monomer. When formulated with alum adjuvant, mHla-RBD immunization significantly increased the immunogenicity of RBD, as indicated by increased titers of RBD-specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, Th2 cellular immune response, and pseudovirus neutralization activity, when compared to RBD monomer. Furthermore, we confirmed that RBD-specific antibodies predominantly target conformational epitopes, which was approximately 200 times that targeting linear epitopes. Finally, a pseudovirus neutralization assay revealed that neutralizing antibodies induced by mHla-RBD against different SARS-CoV-2 variants were comparable to those against the wild-type virus and showed broad-spectrum neutralizing activity toward different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results demonstrated that mHla-RBD is a promising candidate antigen for development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the mHla could serve as a universal carrier protein for antigen design.',\n",

Though vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed to fight COVID-19 in the past year, one major concern is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 VOCs such as B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1 (Brazil), and B.1.617.1 (India) now dominate the pandemic. Herein, we found that binding activity and neutralizing capacity of sera collected from convalescent patients in early 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, but not non-VOC variants, were severely blunted. Furthermore, we observed evasion of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from a VH3-30 mAb 32D4, which was proved to exhibit highly potential neutralization against wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2. Thus, these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be able to spread in convalescent patients and even harbor resistance to medical countermeasures.

This health crisis has resulted in a significant effort to stop the spread of this new coronavirus. However, while propagating itself in the human population, the virus accumulates mutations and generates new variants with increased fitness and the ability to escape the human immune response. Here we describe a color-based barcoded spike flow cytometric assay (BSFA) that is particularly useful to evaluate and directly compare the humoral immune response directed against either wild type (WT) or mutant spike (S) proteins or the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This assay employs the human B lymphoma cell line Ramos, transfected for stable expression of WT or mutant S proteins or a chimeric RBD-CD8 fusion protein. We find that the alpha and beta mutants are more stably expressed than the WT S protein on the Ramos B cell surface and/or bind with higher affinity to the viral entry receptor ACE2. However, we find a reduce expression of the chimeric RBD-CD8 carrying the point mutation N501Y and E484K characteristic for the alpha and beta variant, respectively. The comparison of the humoral immune response of 12 vaccinated probands with 12 COVID-19 patients shows that after the boost, the S-specific IgG class immune response in the vaccinated group is similar to that of the patient group. However, in comparison to WT the specific IgG serum antibodies bind less well to the alpha variant and only poorly to the beta variant S protein. This is in line with the notion that the beta variant is an immune escape variant of SARS-CoV-2. The IgA class immune response was more variable than the IgG response and higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the vaccinated group. In summary, we think that our BSFA represents a useful tool to evaluate the humoral immunity against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to analyze new vaccination protocols against these variants.',\n",

This is important to predict the current and future status of the pandemic. With the recent emergence of new and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants, assays allowing for high throughput analysis of antibodies able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 become even more important. Here, we report the development and validation of a robust, high throughput method, which enables the assessment of antibodies inhibiting the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay uses recombinantly produced spike-f and ACE2 and is performed in a bead array format, which allows analysis of up to 384 samples in parallel per instrument over seven hours, demanding only one hour of manual handling. The method is compared to a microneutralization assay utilising live SARS-CoV-2 and is shown to deliver highly correlating data. Further, a comparison with a serological method that measures all antibodies recognizing the spike protein shows that this type of assessment provides important insights into the neutralizing efficiency of the antibodies, especially for individuals with low antibody levels. This method can be an important and valuable tool for large-scale assessment of antibody-based neutralization, including neutralization of new spike variants that might emerge.',\n",

We tested the sensitivity and performance of a simple and rapid SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T cell test based on the stimulation of whole blood with peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, followed by cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2) measurement in different cohorts including BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals (n = 112), convalescent asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients (n = 130), and SARS-CoV-1-convalescent individuals (n = 12). The sensitivity of this rapid test is comparable to that of traditional methods of T cell analysis (ELISPOT, activation-induced marker). Using this test, we observed a similar mean magnitude of T cell responses between the vaccinees and SARS-CoV-2 convalescents 3 months after vaccination or virus priming. However, a wide heterogeneity of the magnitude of spike-specific T cell responses characterized the individual responses, irrespective of the time of analysis. The magnitude of these spike-specific T cell responses cannot be predicted from the neutralizing antibody levels. Hence, both humoral and cellular spike-specific immunity should be tested after vaccination to define the correlates of protection necessary to evaluate current vaccine strategies.',\n",

In this study, the antibody response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was analyzed by a panel of sera from animals immunized with RBD-based antigens and four linear B-cell epitope peptides (R345, R405, R450 and R465) were revealed. The immunogenicity of three immunodominant peptides (R345, R405, R465) was further accessed by peptide immunization in mice, and all of them could induced potent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that the three determinants in the RBD were immunogenic. We further generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (15G9, 12C10 and 10D2) binding to these epitope peptides, and finely mapped the three immunodominant epitopes using the corresponding antibodies. Neutralization assays showed that all three monoclonal antibodies had neutralization activity.

The overall ensemble of ∼120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody-target interaction, is easily recognizable in EM images due to its unique shape, and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23-kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2-Å overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22-kDa receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6-Å resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody.

Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are similarly resilient to many RBD residue substitutions tested, although mutations at and surrounding position 484 have negative consequences for neutralization. Mosaic and cocktail nanoparticle immunogens displaying multiple sarbecovirus RBDs elicit broad neutralizing activity in mice and protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that multivalent sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and motivates advancing such broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, antigenicity concerns continue to linger with emerging mutants. As recent variants have shown decreased reactivity to previously determined monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or sera, monitoring the antigenicity change of circulating mutants is urgently needed for vaccine effectiveness. Currently, antigenic comparison is mainly carried out by immuno-binding assays. Yet, an online predicting system is highly desirable to complement the targeted experimental tests from the perspective of time and cost. Here, we provided a platform of SAS (Spike protein Antigenicity for SARS-CoV-2), enabling predicting the resistant effect of emerging variants and the dynamic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among circulating strains. When being compared to experimental results, SAS prediction obtained the consistency of 100% on 8 mAb-binding tests with detailed epitope covering mutational sites, and 80.3% on 223 anti-serum tests. Moreover, on the latest South Africa escaping strain (B.1.351), SAS predicted a significant resistance to reference strain at multiple mutated epitopes, agreeing well with the vaccine evaluation results. SAS enables auto-updating from GISAID, and the current version collects 867K GISAID strains, 15.4K unique spike (S) variants, and 28 validated and predicted epitope regions that include 339 antigenic sites. Together with the targeted immune-binding experiments, SAS may be helpful to reduce the experimental searching space, indicate the emergence and expansion of antigenic variants, and suggest the dynamic coverage of representative mAbs/vaccines among the latest circulating strains.

       "  'abstract': 'The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants has quickly spanned doubts and the fear about their ability escape vaccine protection. Some of these variants initially identified in caged were also found in humans. The claim that these variants exhibited lower susceptibility to antibody neutralization led to the slaughter of 17 million minks in Denmark. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence tests led to the discovery of infected farmed minks worldwide. In this study, we revisit the issue of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in minks as a model of sarbecovirus interspecies evolution by: (1) comparing human and mink angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) receptors; (2) comparing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from humans and minks; (3) analyzing the impact of mutations on the 3D structure of the spike protein; and (4) predicting linear epitope targets for immune response. Mink-selected SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the Y453F/D614G mutations display an increased affinity for human ACE2 and can escape neutralization by one monoclonal antibody. However, they are unlikely to lose most of the major epitopes predicted to be targets for neutralizing antibodies. We discuss the consequences of these results for the rational use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) involves the attachment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike proteins to the ACE2 receptors on the peripheral membrane of host cells. Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies that search for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD. However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and is therefore a hotspot for drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and residues distant to it in the spike protein. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular recognition events and prediction of the highest-effect key mutations in distant, allosteric sites, with implications for therapeutics. Also, these sites can appear in emerging mutants with possibly higher transmissibility and virulence, and preidentifying them can give clues for designing pan-coronavirus vaccines against future outbreaks. Our model, based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Residues involved in the most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab initio from our model. Conversely, broad-spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal antibodies can target these key distant-but-conserved regions of the spike protein.',\n",

Three major outbreaks followed, resulting in over 800,000 cases and over 6,000 deaths by April 2021. Our aim was characterization of a serological snapshot of Israeli patients and healthy adults in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sera from 55 symptomatic COVID-19 patients and 146 healthy subjects (early-pandemic, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR [qRT-PCR]-negative), collected in Israel between March and April 2020, were screened for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, using a 6-plex antigen microarray presenting the whole inactivated virus and five viral antigens: a stabilized version of the spike ectodomain (S2P), spike subunit 1 (S1), receptor-binding-domain (RBD), N-terminal-domain (NTD), and nucleocapsid (NC). COVID-19 patients, 4 to 40\\u2009days post symptom onset, presented specific IgG to all of the viral antigens (6/6) in 54 of the 55 samples (98% sensitivity). Specific IgM and IgA antibodies for all six antigens were detected in only 10% (5/55) and 4% (2/55) of the patients, respectively, suggesting that specific IgG is a superior serological marker for COVID-19. None of the qRT-PCR-negative sera reacted with all six viral antigens (100% specificity), and 48% (70/146) were negative throughout the panel. Our findings confirm a low seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Israeli adult population prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We further suggest that the presence of low-level cross-reacting antibodies in naive individuals calls for a combined, multiantigen analysis for accurate discrimination between naive and exposed individuals.

       "  'abstract': 'What enabled SARS-CoV-2, but not other coronaviruses, to cause a global pandemic? Here we investigated key structural determinants of the pandemic. Using SARS-CoV-1 and bat RaTG13-CoV as comparisons, we identified two molecular switches that regulate the conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: (i) a furin motif loop turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from a closed conformation to a mixture of open and closed conformations, and (ii) a K417V mutation turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from mixed conformations to an open conformation. We showed that the open conformation favors viral potency by exposing the RBD for receptor binding and viral entry, while the closed conformation supports viral immune evasion by hiding the RBD from neutralizing antibodies. Hence SARS-CoV-2 spike has evolved to reach a balance between potency and immune evasiveness, which contributes to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2.The dynamics between viral potency and invasiveness is likely to further evolve, providing insights into future evolution of SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Herein, SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide immunoprofiling of children with mild/moderate or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) versus multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children versus hospitalized control patients revealed differential cytokine responses, IgM/IgG/IgA epitope diversity, antibody binding and avidity. Apart from spike and nucleocapsid, IgG/IgA recognized epitopes in nonstructural protein (NSP) 2, NSP3, NSP12-NSP14 and open reading frame (ORF) 3a-ORF9. Peptides representing epitopes in NSP12, ORF3a and ORF8 demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnosis. Antibody-binding kinetics with 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed antibody parameters that distinguish children with mild/moderate versus severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Antibody avidity to prefusion spike correlated with decreased illness severity and served as a clinical disease indicator. The fusion peptide and heptad repeat 2 region induced SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Thus, we identified SARS-CoV-2 antibody signatures in children associated with disease severity and delineate promising serodiagnostic and virus neutralization targets. These findings might guide the design of serodiagnostic assays, prognostic algorithms, therapeutics and vaccines in this important but understudied population.',\n",

Much of this response has focused, appropriately, on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, and in particular the binding of the spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and subsequent membrane fusion. This Review provides the structural and cellular foundations for understanding the multistep SARS-CoV-2 entry process, including S protein synthesis, S protein structure, conformational transitions necessary for association of the S protein with ACE2, engagement of the receptor-binding domain of the S protein with ACE2, proteolytic activation of the S protein, endocytosis and membrane fusion. We define the roles of furin-like proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in these processes, and delineate the features of ACE2 orthologues in reservoir animal species and S protein adaptations that facilitate efficient human transmission. We also examine the utility of vaccines, antibodies and other potential therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms. Finally, we present key outstanding questions associated with this critical process.',\n",

Only immunocompromised Status is associated with lack of seroconversion (OR 7.6 [1.5-38.2], p = 0.02). We also identify factors associated with low response (last quartile; IgG<500AU/mL): immunocompromised status, age, absence of RAAS inhibitors, low lymphocytes count, high C Reactive Protein; and with high response (high quartile; IgG>7000AU/mL): age; previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and active Cancer.

To better understand the features of immune memory in individuals with different disease severities at one year post-disease onset we conducted this cohort study.\\nWe conducted a systematic antigen-specific immune evaluation in 101 COVID-19 convalescents, who had asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe disease, through two visits at months 6 and 12 post-disease onset. The SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, comprising NAb, IgG, and IgM, were assessed by mutually corroborated assays, i.e. neutralization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and microparticle chemiluminescence immunoassay (MCLIA). Meanwhile, the T-cell memory against SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins was tested through enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot), intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and tetramer staining-based flow cytometry, respectively.\\nSARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, and also NAb can persist among over 95% COVID-19 convalescents from 6 months to 12 months after disease onset. At least 19/71 (26%) of COVID-19 convalescents (double positive in ELISA and MCLIA) had detectable circulating IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 at 12m post-disease onset.

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit a humoral immune response capable of neutralising the virus. However, multiple variants have emerged with mutations in the spike protein amongst others, the key target of neutralising antibodies. We evaluated the neutralising efficacy of 89 serum samples from patients, infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of 2020, against two virus variants isolated from acutely infected patients and harbouring spike protein mutations. One isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.351 (MUC-IMB-B.1.351) whilst the other (MUC-484) was isolated from an immunocompromised patient, sharing some but not all mutations with B.1.351 and representing a transitional variant. Both variants showed a significant reduction in neutralisation sensitivity compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with MUC-IMB-B.1.351 being almost completely resistant to neutralisation. The observed reduction in neutralising activity of wild-type-specific antibodies against both variants suggests that individual mutations in the spike protein are sufficient to confer a potent escape from the humoral immune response. In addition, the effect of escape mutations seems to accumulate, so that more heavily mutated variants show a greater loss of sensitivity to neutralisation up to complete insensitivity as observed for MUC-IMB-B.1.351. From a clinical point of view, this might affect the efficacy of (monoclonal) antibody treatment of patients with prolonged infections as well as patients infected with variants other than the donor. At the same, this could also negatively influence the efficacy of current vaccines (as they are based on wild-type spike protein) emphasising the need to thoroughly surveil the emergence and distribution of variants and adapt vaccines and therapeutics accordingly.',\n",

We report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells in human tonsillar tissue obtained from children who were negative for coronavirus disease 2019 prior to the pandemic and the generation of mAbs recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein from these B cells. These Abs showed reduced binding to Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants and did not recognize Spike proteins of endemic coronaviruses, but subsets reacted with commensal microbiota and exhibited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing potential. Our study demonstrates pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive Abs in various B cell populations in the upper respiratory tract lymphoid tissue that may lead to the rapid engagement of the pathogen and contribute to prevent manifestations of symptomatic or severe disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most known SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), including those approved by the FDA for emergency use, inhibit viral infection by targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150, and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent-phase sera were reduced by 4- to 16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E, or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs did not enhance their neutralization potential. Notably, the same combination of RBD and NTD nAbs limited the development of neutralization-escape mutants ',\n",

We now investigate the neutralization sensitivity of variants containing the non-RBD mutation Q677H, including B.1.525 (Nigerian isolate) and Bluebird (U.S. isolate) variants. The effect on neutralization of Q677H was determined in the context of the RBD mutations and in the background of major VOCs, including B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom, Alpha), B.1.351 (South Africa, Beta), and P1-501Y-V3 (Brazil, Gamma).

Euroimmun ELISA anti-spike 1 IgG, Euroimmun anti-spike 1 IgG QuantiVac ELISA, Elecsys Anti-nucleocapsid protein total antibodies, Elecsys Anti-receptor-binding domain total antibodies, VIDAS anti-spike subdomain IgG, and Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG assay were performed on 228 sera from 89 healthcare workers who participated in a six-month seroprevalence survey. Although all immunoassays demonstrated similar performances, VIDAS SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Euroimmun QuantiVac IgG (area under the curve 0.96 and 0.95 respectively) showed the better ability to detect Nabs. Except for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assays, the commercial serologic tests evaluated here showed a significant decrease of antibody titers in the 6-month follow-up samples. Depending on the immunoassay, 21% to 33% of the participants became seronegative, and 16.9% had a loss of neutralizing antibodies. Microblot-Array assay results showed cross-reactivity with HCoVNL63 in only one sample, and this sample showed SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity. In conclusion, our results support the use of VIDAS SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA IgG and Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG assays to monitor neutralizing antibody response following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this review, we discuss the molecular determinants of S mediated fusion and the antiviral innate immunity components that counteract syncytia formation.

Subunit vaccines are considered among the safest, but proteins used in these typically lack strong immunogenicity, leading to poor immune responses. Here, a biomaterial COVID-19 vaccine based on a mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) platform is described. MSRs loaded with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), and SARS-CoV-2 viral protein antigens slowly release their cargo and form subcutaneous scaffolds that locally recruit and activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the generation of adaptive immunity. MSR-based vaccines generate robust and durable cellular and humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the poorly immunogenic receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Persistent antibodies over the course of 8 months are found in all vaccine configurations tested and robust in vitro viral neutralization is observed both in a prime-boost and a single-dose regimen. These vaccines can be fully formulated ahead of time or stored lyophilized and reconstituted with an antigen mixture moments before injection, which can facilitate its rapid deployment against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or new pathogens. Together, the data show a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate and a generally adaptable vaccine platform against infectious pathogens.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research articles for the current study were searched over PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science online databases. The keywords used were: ((\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\") AND (\"mutation\" OR \"variant\") AND (\"death\" OR \"hospitalization\" OR \"infection\" OR \"transmission\") AND (\"antibody\" OR \"neutralize\" OR \"vaccine\")). A total of 333 research articles were retrieved through online-database search. These articles were further scrutinized for their relevancy. Additionally, searches were performed to find the latest relevant information over Google search engine and relevant news browsers. Finally, around 35 germane articles were considered for scripting the current report. RESULTS: The mutations have changed amino acids at key positions in spike protein viz. S477N, E484K, Q677H, E484Q, L452R, K417T, K417N and N501Y. These mutations are relevant for different characteristics and are present in newly evolved strains of SARS-CoV-2 like E484K in B.1.526, B.1.525, P.2, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351. Mutations have increased the immune escape potential leading to 3.5-6.5-folds decrease in neutralization of antibodies (Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). The variant, B.1.617 circulating in India and many other countries (double variant) having E484Q and L452R mutations, has raised the infection rate and decreased the neutralization capacity of the vaccine-induced antibodies. Deadly K417N+E484K+N501Y triplet mutations found in B.1.351 and P.1 have increased the transmission ability of these strains by 50% leading to greater COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admissions and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The new SARS-CoV-2 variants have compromised the neutralization potential of the currently used vaccines, but still, they have considerable efficacy to reduce infection and mortality.\\nhttps://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Graphical_Abstract.jpg.',\n",

Total antibody testing (Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike) were complemented by receptor binding domain indirect ELISA and neutralising antibody assays.\\nThe first two SARS-CoV-2 confirmed reinfections had mild symptomatic illness episodes from which infectious virus was recovered at the time of reinfection. The recovered viruses and their sequences were closely related to viruses circulating locally during the time of reinfection and serology was consistent with reinfection. Prior to reinfection, both cases had ELISA and immunoblot detectable anti-N antibodies, but lacked live virus neutralising antibody. Within days following reinfection, neutralising antibodies became detectable and anti-N and anti-S binding antibodies were boosted.\\nWe hypothesise that titres of neutralising antibody can be used as a correlate of protection against reinfection. Further analysis using a case-control design is essential in order to confirm this hypothesis.',\n",

The humoral immune response magnitude, composition and efficacy of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 are essential endpoints for these trials. Robust assays that are reproducibly precise, linear, and specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens would be beneficial for the vaccine pipeline. In this work we describe the methodologies and clinical qualification of three SARS-CoV-2 endpoint assays. We developed and qualified Endpoint titer ELISAs for total IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, IgM and IgA to evaluate the magnitude of specific responses to the trimeric spike (S) antigen and total IgG specific to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We also qualified a pseudovirus neutralization assay which evaluates functional antibody titers capable of inhibiting the entry and replication of a lentivirus containing the Spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. To complete the suite of assays we qualified a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) methodology using the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 to assess neutralizing titers of antibodies in plasma from normal healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 individuals.',\n",

However, the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients undergoing treatment remain unclear.\\nIn this interventional prospective multicohort study, priming and booster doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine were administered 21 days apart to solid tumor patients receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted or hormonal therapy, and patients with a hematologic malignancy receiving rituximab or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Vaccine safety and efficacy (until 3 months post-booster) were assessed.

Local, but not systemic, AEs occurred more frequently after the booster dose. Twenty-eight days after the booster vaccination of 197 cancer patients, RBD-binding antibody titers and NT50 were lower in the chemotherapy group {234.05 IU/ml [95% confidence interval (CI) 122.10-448.66] and 24.54 (95% CI 14.50-41.52), respectively} compared with healthy individuals [1844.93 IU/ml (95% CI 1383.57-2460.14) and 122.63 (95% CI 76.85-195.67), respectively], irrespective of timing of vaccination during chemotherapy cycles.

The trial was conducted at 9 sites in Australia and 8 sites in the United States. Participants in 2 age groups (aged 18 to 59 and 60 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 1 or 2 intramuscular doses of 5-μg or 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7-day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild-type virus neutralizing antibody response. After enrollment, 1,288 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vaccine groups or placebo, with 1,283 participants administered at least 1 study treatment. Of these, 45% were older participants 60 to 84 years. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose. Reactogenicity occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. Both 2-dose regimens of 5-μg and 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 induced robust immune responses in younger and older participants. For the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg, geometric mean titers (GMTs) for IgG anti-spike protein were 65,019 (95% confidence interval (CI) 55,485 to 76,192) and 28,137 (95% CI 21,617 to 36,623) EU/mL and for wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (with an inhibitory concentration of 50%-MN50%) were 2,201 (95% CI 1,343 to 3,608) and 981 (95% CI 560 to 1,717) titers for younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in a panel of convalescent sera for both age groups. Study limitations include the relatively short duration of safety follow-up to date and current lack of immune persistence data beyond the primary vaccination regimen time point assessments, but these data will accumulate over time.\\nThe study confirmed the phase 1 findings that the 2-dose regimen of 5-μg NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in younger adults. In addition, in older adults, the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg was also well tolerated and showed sufficient immunogenicity to support its use in late-phase efficacy studies.\\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04368988.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the absence of effective antiviral chemotherapy and still in the context of emerging vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 infections, passive immunotherapy remains a key treatment and possible prevention strategy. What might initially be conceived as a simplified donor-recipient process, the intricacies of donor plasma, IV immunoglobulins, and monoclonal antibody modality applications are becoming more apparent. Key targets of such treatment have largely focused on virus neutralization and the specific viral components of the attachment Spike protein and its constituents (e.g., receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain). The cumulative laboratory and clinical experience suggests that beneficial protective and treatment outcomes are possible. Both a dose- and a time-dependency emerge. Lesser understood are the concepts of bioavailability and distribution. Apart from direct antigen binding from protective immunoglobulins, antibody effector functions have potential roles in outcome. In attempting to mimic the natural but variable response to infection or vaccination, a strong functional polyclonal approach attracts the potential benefits of attacking antigen diversity, high antibody avidity, antibody persistence, and protection against escape viral mutation. The availability and ease of administration for any passive immunotherapy product must be considered in the current climate of need. There is never a perfect product, but yet there is considerable room for improving patient outcomes. Given the variability of human genetics, immunity, and disease, and given the nuances of the virus and its potential for change, passive immunotherapy can be developed that will be effective for some but not all patients. An understanding of such patient variability and limitations is just as important as the understanding of the direct interactions between immunotherapy and virus.',\n",

In most patients with cancer, we detected spike receptor-binding domain and other S1-specific memory B cell subsets as potential predictors of anamnestic responses to additional immunizations. We therefore initiated a phase 1 trial for 20 cancer cohort participants of a third vaccine dose of BNT162b2 ( NCT04936997 ); primary outcomes were immune responses, with a secondary outcome of safety. At 1 week after a third immunization, 16 participants demonstrated a median threefold increase in neutralizing antibody responses, but no improvement was observed in T cell responses.

       "  'abstract': 'Extremely rare reactions characterized by thrombosis and thrombocytopenia have been described in subjects that received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination 5-16 days earlier. Although patients with vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes, the exact mechanism of the development of thrombosis is still unknown. Here we reported serum studies as well as proteomics and genomics analyses demonstrating a massive complement activation potentially linked to the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies in a patient with severe VITT. At admission, complement activity of the classical and lectin pathways were absent (0% for both) with normal levels of the alternative pathway (73%) in association with elevated levels of the complement activation marker sC5b-9 (630\\xa0ng/mL [n.v. 139-462\\xa0ng/mL]) and anti-PF4 IgG (1.918 OD [n.v. 0.136-0.300 OD]). The immunoblotting analysis of C2 showed the complete disappearance of its normal band at 110\\xa0kDa. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment allowed to recover complement activity of the classical pathway (91%) and lectin pathway (115%), to reduce levels of sC5b-9 (135\\xa0ng/mL) and anti-PF4 IgG (0.681 OD) and to normalize the C2 pattern at immunoblotting. Proteomics and genomics analyses in addition to serum studies showed that the absence of complement activity during VITT was not linked to alterations of the C2 gene but rather to a strong complement activation leading to C2 consumption. Our data in a single patient suggest monitoring complement parameters in other VITT patients considering also the possibility to target complement activation with specific drugs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'N-glycosylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. However, the role of SARS-CoV-2 RBD N-glycosylation in viral entry remains elusive. In this study, we expressed and purified N331 and N343 N-glycosite mutants of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that de-glycosylation at N331 and N343 drastically reduces the RBD binding to ACE2. More importantly, based on qualitative and quantitative virology research methods, we show that the mutation of RBD N-glycosites interfered with SARS-CoV-2 internalization rather than attachment potentially by decreasing RBD binding to the receptors. Also, the double N-glycosites mutant (N331\\xa0+\\xa0N343) showed significantly increased sensitivity against the designated RBD neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these results suggest that N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is not only critical for viral internalization into respiratory epithelial cells but also shields the virus from neutralization. It may provide new insights into the biological process of early-stage SARS-CoV-2 infection with potential therapeutic implications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages that are more transmissible and resistant to currently approved antibody therapies poses a considerable challenge to the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, the need for ongoing discovery efforts to identify broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance. Here, we report a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies isolated using the linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq) technology from an individual who recovered from COVID-19. Of these antibodies, 54042-4 shows potent neutralization against authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses, including variants of concern (VOCs). A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 54042-4 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals an epitope composed of residues that are highly conserved in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Further, 54042-4 possesses uncommon genetic and structural characteristics that distinguish it from other potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Together, these findings provide motivation for the development of 54042-4 as a lead candidate to counteract current and future SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.',\n",

In particular, the emergence of several variants with greater infectivity and resistance to current vaccines has motivated the development of a vaccine that elicits a broadly neutralizing immune response against all variants. In this study, we used a nanoparticle-based vaccine platform for the multivalent display of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Multiple copies of RBD were conjugated to the SpyCatcher-mi3 protein nanoparticle to produce a highly immunogenic nanoparticle-based vaccine. RBD-SpyCatcher-mi3 vaccines elicited broadly cross-reactive antibodies that recognized the spike proteins of not just an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but also three SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern as well as SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, immunization elicited high neutralizing antibody titers against an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2 as well as four variants of concern, including the delta variant. These results reveal the potential of RBD-SpyCatcher-mi3 as a broadly protective vaccination strategy.',\n",

We evaluated the performances of the following six commercially available serological assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: (i) Genscript cPass surrogate virus neutralization test (Genscript cPass), (ii) Diasorin-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG detection (Diasorin-S1/S2 IgG), (iii) Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (Alinity IgG II), (iv) Diasorin-SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (Diasorin-TrimericS IgG), (v) Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2-cobas (Roche Elecsys), and (vi) AESKU enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (AESKULISA). The results of these tests were compared against the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Roche Elecsys had the highest sensitivity, and the Genscript cPass had the highest specificity. Diasorin-TrimericS IgG had the best overall performance with the highest agreement with the PRNT results. Parallel testing of Genscript cPass with Diasorin-TrimericS IgG and Diasorin-S1/S2 IgG had the optimum performance. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, lowering the cutoff from 30% to 20% in the Genscript cPass significantly increased the sensitivity and the overall agreement with the PRNT results. Commercially available serological assays are good alternatives to the standard PRNT. However, further studies on larger sample numbers are required for optimization of the assay cutoff values and for evaluation of cost effectiveness. ',\n",

In this study, a microchip-based grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonic (GC-FP) assay was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from COVID-19 infection and vaccination. In addition, we measured the relative antibody binding toward antigens from the CoV2 virus variants strains B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta). Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals, while those against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence and also resolved acute (within hours) increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant, but not B.1.1.7, was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens. These results were corroborated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collectively, the findings suggest that GC-FP is a viable, rapid, and accurate method for measuring both overall antibody levels to SARS CoV2 and relative antibody binding to viral variants during infection or vaccination.

       "  'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells upon binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors. Several nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, but how their binding antagonizes S-ACE2 interactions is not well understood. Here, we identified interactions between the RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. H11-H4 and H11-D4 can bind to RBD without overlapping with ACE2. H11-H4, and to a lesser extent H11-D4, binding dislocates ACE2 from its binding site due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 overlaps with ACE2 on RBD and has a similar binding strength to ACE2. Mutations in the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 had a minor effect in RBD binding strengths of ACE2 and nanobodies, but reduced the ability of H11-H4 and H11-D4 to dislocate ACE2 from RBD. In comparison, the Beta variant weakened the RBD binding strengths of H11-H4 and H11-D4, which were less effective to dislocate ACE2 binding. Unexpectedly, mutations in Beta strengthened Ty1 binding to RBD, suggesting that this nanobody may be more effective to neutralize the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

In order to estimate the duration of immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 it is important to understand for how long antibodies persist after infection in humans. Here, we assessed the persistence of serum antibodies following WT SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 and 13 months after diagnosis in 367 individuals. The SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG (S-IgG) and nucleoprotein IgG (N-IgG) concentrations and the proportion of subjects with neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assessed. Moreover, the NAb titers among a smaller subset of participants (n = 78) against a WT virus (B) and variants of concern (VOCs): Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) were determined. We found that NAb against the WT virus persisted in 89% and S-IgG in 97% of subjects for at least 13 months after infection. Only 36% had N-IgG by 13 months. The mean S-IgG concentrations declined from 8 to 13 months by less than one third; N-IgG concentrations declined by two-thirds. Subjects with severe infection had markedly higher IgG and NAb levels and are expected to remain seropositive for longer. Significantly lower NAb titers against the variants compared to the WT virus, especially after a mild disease, suggests reduced protection against VOCs.',\n",

KTX recipients also displayed reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell frequencies.

Neutralizing antibodies present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and directed against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein are considered to play a major role in the viral clearance. CP infusion may also contribute to the modulation of the immune response through its immunomodulatory effect.

No minimal severity threshold and no biological cure criteria were required. Donors could return to a second plasma donation 14 days after the first donation. A minimal neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40 was considered for clinical use.\\nEighty-eight donors were included (median age 35 [28-48] years, 41 women), and 149 plasma products were collected. COVID-19 were mainly WHO stage 2 infections (96%). Among the 88 first donations, 76% had neutralizing antibody titers higher than or equal to 1:40. Eighty-eight percent of donors who came for a second donation had a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40. Median durations were 15 (15-19) and 38 (33-46) days from the first to the second donation and from recovery to the second donation, respectively.

In this study, we explored potential entry sites for SARS-CoV-2 by viral S protein histochemistry on various ocular tissues and compared the staining patterns with RNA and protein expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2. Potential viral entry sites were investigated by histochemistry using tagged recombinant viral S protein on 52 ocular tissue samples including specimens of the cornea, conjunctiva, lid margin, lacrimal gland tissue, retina, choroid, and RPE. In addition, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 immunohistochemistry were performed on the same ocular tissue, each with distinct antibodies binding to different epitopes. Lung tissue samples were used as positive controls. Finally, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to determine the expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary factors in the tissues mentioned above. S protein histochemistry revealed a positive staining in lung tissue but absent staining in the cornea, the conjunctiva, eye lid samples, the lacrimal glands, the retina and the optic nerve which was supported by hardly any immunoreactivity for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and scarce ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA expression. Negligible staining with antibodies targeting ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was seen in the main and accessory lacrimal glands. In contrast, ocular staining (S protein, ACE2, TMPRSS2) was distinctly present in pigmented cells of the RPE and choroid, as well as in the ciliary body and the iris stroma. S protein histochemistry revealed hardly any SARS-CoV-2 entry sites in all ocular tissues examined. Similarly, no significant ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression was found in extra- and intraocular tissue. While this study suggest a rather low risk of ocular infection with SARS-CoV-2, it should be noted, that potential viral entry sites may increase in response to inflammation or in certain disease states.',\n",

Here, we obtain two cross-neutralizing antibodies (7D6 and 6D6) that target Sarbecoviruses' receptor-binding domain (RBD) with sub-picomolar affinities and potently neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2. Crystal structures show that both antibodies bind a cryptic site different from that recognized by existing antibodies and highly conserved across Sarbecovirus isolates. Binding of these two antibodies to the RBD clashes with the adjacent N-terminal domain and disrupts the viral spike. Both antibodies confer good resistance to mutations in the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus, our results have direct relevance to public health as options for passive antibody therapeutics and even active prophylactics. They can also inform the design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.\",\n",

The high transmission rate and the emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants demand rapid and effective approaches to preventing the spread, diagnosing on time, and treating affected people. Several COVID-19 vaccines are being developed using different production systems, including plants, which promises the production of cheap, safe, stable, and effective vaccines. The potential of a plant-based system for rapid production at a commercial scale and for a quick response to an infectious disease outbreak has been demonstrated by the marketing of carrot-cell-produced taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) for Gaucher disease and tobacco-produced monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp) for the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Currently, two plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates, coronavirus virus-like particle (CoVLP) and Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP)-201, are in clinical trials, and many more are in the preclinical stage. Interim phase 2 clinical trial results have revealed the high safety and efficacy of the CoVLP vaccine, with 10 times more neutralizing antibody responses compared to those present in a convalescent patient's plasma. The clinical trial of the CoVLP vaccine could be concluded by the end of 2021, and the vaccine could be available for public immunization thereafter. This review encapsulates the efforts made in plant-based COVID-19 vaccine development, the strategies and technologies implemented, and the progress accomplished in clinical trials and preclinical studies so far.\",\n",

Only one of the 19 analyzed subjects showed no antibody response toward any of the selected peptides, consistently with a lower neutralizing capacity. More importantly, our data showed that the antibody response elicited by inoculation of the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine appears to be qualitatively individual, both in the type of recognized peptides and in the temporal persistence of the antibody response.

Serological tests offer numerous benefits compared to other assay platforms to screen large populations. First-generation assays contain targets that represent proteins from SARS-CoV-2. While they could be quickly produced, each actually has a mixture of specific and non-specific epitopes that vary in their reactivity for antibodies. To generate the next generation of the assay, epitopes were identified in three SARS-Cov-2 proteins (S, N, and Orf3a) by SPOT synthesis analysis. After their similarity to other pathogen sequences was analyzed, 11 epitopes outside of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that showed high reactivity and uniqueness to the virus. These were incorporated into a ß-barrel protein core to create a highly chimeric protein. Another de novo protein was designed that contained only epitopes in the RBD.

In this study, we determined whether a combination of toll-like receptor (TLR)1/2 and TLR3 agonists (L-pampo) can be a potent adjuvant for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccine. We measured a neutralizing antibody (nAb) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-blocking antibody against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). We also detected interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by using ELISPOT and ELISA assays. By employing a ferret model, we detected nAbs and IFN-γ producing cells and measured viral load in nasal wash after the challenge of SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antigens with L-pampo stimulated robust humoral and cellular immune responses. The efficacy of L-pampo was higher than the other adjuvants. Furthermore, in the ferret model, SARS-CoV-2 antigens with L-pampo elicited nAb response and antigen-specific cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2, resulting in substantially decreased viral load in their nasal wash. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antigens formulated with TLR agonists, L-pampo, can be a potent subunit vaccine to promote sufficient protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has led to health, social and economic consequences for public health systems. As a result, the development of safe and effective vaccines, in order to contain the infection quickly became a priority. The first vaccine approved by the Italian Agency for Drugs Authorization (AIFA) was the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, developed by BioNTech and Pfizer (Comirnaty). Comirnaty contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a nucleoside-modified RNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Even if data from phase I suggest that vaccine induced antibodies can persist for up to six months following the second shot of BNT vaccine, data regarding the real duration of immunological protection are lacking. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the duration of serological protection by detecting the presence of anti-S-RBD (receptor-binding domain) antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 among a large group of healthcare workers (HCWs) three months after vaccination. 99% of HCWs had a detectable titre of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 90 days after the second vaccine shot. Elderly operators showed significantly lower levels of protective antibodies when compared to the younger ones, thus they could become unprotected earlier than other operators.',\n",

Convalescent plasma (CP) infusion might also develop into a safe and effective treatment modality on the basis of recent studies and meta-analyses; however, little is known regarding the kinetics of antibodies in CP recipients. To evaluate the kinetics, we followed 31 CP recipients longitudinally enrolled at a median of 3 days post symptom onset for changes in binding and neutralizing antibody titers and viral loads. Antibodies against the complete trimeric Spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD), as well as against the complete Nucleocapsid protein and the RNA binding domain (N-RBD) were determined at baseline and weekly following CP infusion. Neutralizing antibody (pseudotype NAb) titers were determined at the same time points. Viral loads were determined semi-quantitatively by SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Patients with low humoral responses at entry showed a robust increase of antibodies to all SARS-CoV-2 proteins and Nab, reaching peak levels within 2 weeks. The rapid increase in binding and neutralizing antibodies was paralleled by a concomitant clearance of the virus within the same timeframe. Patients with high humoral responses at entry demonstrated low or no further increases; however, virus clearance followed the same trajectory as in patients with low antibody response at baseline. Together, the sequential immunological and virological analysis of this well-defined cohort of patients early in infection shows the presence of high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies and potent clearance of the virus.',\n",

We found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring L452R had reduced susceptibility to convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and mAbs. Compared to B.1, Kappa and Delta showed a reduced neutralization by convalescent sera by a factor of 8.00 and 5.33, respectively, which constitutes a 2-fold greater reduction when compared to Epsilon. BNT2b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera were less effective against Kappa, Delta, and Epsilon compared to B.1. No difference was observed between Kappa and Delta towards vaccine-elicited sera, whereas convalescent sera were 1.51-fold less effective against Delta, respectively. Both B.1.617 variants Kappa (+E484Q) and Delta (+T478K) were less susceptible to either casirivimab or imdevimab. In conclusion, in contrast to the parallel circulating Kappa variant, the neutralization efficiency of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera against Delta was moderately reduced. Delta was resistant to imdevimab, which, however, might be circumvented by combination therapy with casirivimab together.',\n",

Antibodies to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to administration are not routinely tested; therefore, two doses may be administered to asymptomatic previously exposed subjects. The aim of this study is to assess if any difference in antibody concentration between subjects exposed and not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 prior to BNT162b2 was present after the first dose and after the second dose of vaccine. Data were retrospectively collected from the clinical documentation of 337 healthcare workers who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing before and after BNT162b2. Total anti RBD (receptor-binding domain) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2's spike protein were measured before and 21 days after the first dose, and 12 days after the second dose of BNT162b2. Twenty-one days after the first dose, there was a statistically significant difference in antibody concentration between the two groups, which was also maintained twelve days after the second dose. In conclusion, antibody response after receiving BNT162b2 is greater in subjects who have been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 than in subjects who have not been previously exposed to the virus, both after 21 days after the first dose and after 12 days from the second dose. Antibody levels, 21 days after the first dose, reached a titer considered positive by the test manufacturer in the majority of subjects who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Evaluating previous infection prior to vaccination in order to give the least effective number of doses should be considered.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates the viral-host interaction and is a target for most neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations pose a threat due to their role in host cell entry via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor that might strengthen SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, or resistance against neutralizing antibodies. To understand the molecular structural link between RBD mutations and infectivity, the top five mutant RBDs (i.e., N501Y, E484K L452R, S477N, and N439K) were selected based on their recorded case numbers. These mutants along with wild-type (WT) RBD were studied through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns. The principal component analysis and the free energy landscape were used too. Interestingly, N501Y, N439K, and E484K mutations were observed to increase the rigidity in some RBD regions while increasing the flexibility of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region, suggesting a compensation of the entropy penalty. However, S477N and L452R RBDs were observed to increase the flexibility of the RBM region while maintaining similar flexibility in other RBD regions in comparison to WT RBD. Therefore, both mutations (especially S477N) might destabilize the RBD structure, as loose conformation compactness was observed. The destabilizing effect of S477N RBD was consistent with previous work on S477N mutation. Finally, the free energy landscape results showed that mutations changed WT RBD conformation while local minima were maintained for all mutant RBDs. In conclusion, RBD mutations definitely impact the WT RBD structure and conformation as well as increase the binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor.',\n",

Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 1,036,030 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 30,806 NGS datasets from GISAID and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 2.5% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.6% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 5,472 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only 21 and 14 recurrent variants were found in at least 1% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 2.6% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition. These findings demonstrate the continuous importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak since December 2019, antigenic tests are widely used, for diagnosis purposes, to detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in nasopharyngeal fluid through its interactions with specific antibodies. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is subject to rapid mutations yielding more and more variants that might lose their affinity toward the currently used antibodies. The virus entry into the host cell involves interactions between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain. Consequently, ACE2 could be a target with limited mutation escaping possibilities. However, as the enzyme has not evolved to recognize the virus, its affinity with the spike protein receptor-binding domain is lower than that with specific antibodies. The present molecular dynamics simulations study suggests that the adsorption of the ACE2 on specific silane monolayers could increase its affinity toward the spike protein receptor-binding domain. Indeed, silane monolayers, combining silane molecules with short alkyl chains and positively charged head groups and silane molecules without charged head groups, could adsorb the ACE2 while maintaining its bioactivity (orientation compatible with the spike protein trapping, low conformational changes) and increasing its interactions with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions) to lead to an increase by 20% both in the binding free energy and in the enzyme /receptor-binding domain rupture force. This work could help develop biosensing tools efficient toward any variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is an urgent need for new generation anti-SARS-Cov-2 vaccines in order to increase the efficacy of immunization and its broadness of protection against viral variants that are continuously arising and spreading. The effect of variants on protective immunity afforded by vaccination has been mostly analyzed with regard to B cell responses. This analysis revealed variable levels of cross-neutralization capacity for presently available SARS-Cov-2 vaccines. Despite the dampened immune responses documented for some SARS-Cov-2 mutations, available vaccines appear to maintain an overall satisfactory protective activity against most variants of concern (VoC). This may be attributed, at least in part, to cell-mediated immunity. Indeed, the widely multi-specific nature of CD8 T cell responses should allow to avoid VoC-mediated viral escape, because mutational inactivation of a given CD8 T cell epitope is expected to be compensated by the persistent responses directed against unchanged co-existing CD8 epitopes. This is particularly relevant because some immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes are located within highly conserved SARS-Cov-2 regions that cannot mutate without impairing SARS-Cov-2 functionality. Importantly, some of these conserved epitopes are degenerate, meaning that they are able to associate with different HLA class I molecules and to be simultaneously presented to CD8 T cell populations of different HLA restriction. Based on these concepts, vaccination strategies aimed at potentiating the stimulatory effect on SARS-Cov-2-specific CD8 T cells should greatly enhance the efficacy of immunization against SARS-Cov-2 variants. Our review recollects, discusses and puts into a translational perspective all available experimental data\\xa0supporting these \"hot\" concepts, with special emphasis on the structural constraints that limit SARS-CoV-2 S-protein evolution and on potentially invariant and degenerate CD8\\xa0epitopes that lend themselves as excellent candidates for the rational development of next-generation, CD8 T-cell response-reinforced, COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",

An in-depth investigation on COVID-19 pathogenesis is urgently needed to develop a strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we identified CD147 as a universal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Meanwhile, Meplazeumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, could block cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants-alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with inhibition rates of 68.7, 75.7, 52.1, 52.1, and 62.3% at 60\\u2009μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta. When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a \"spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis\": Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway. Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm. Importantly, Meplazumab could effectively inhibit viral entry and inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Therefore, our findings provided a new perspective for severe COVID-19-related pathogenesis.

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 200 million infections and over 4 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by many variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to tighter binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The tighter binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies/nanobodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies/nanobodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies/nanobodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody/nanobody drug design.',\n",

Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggered ADCC responses contributes to COVID-19 disease development is currently not well understood.

ADCC was elicited by 10 days post-infection, peaked by 11-20 days, and remained detectable until 400 days post-infection. In general, patients with severe disease had higher ADCC activities. Notably, patients who had severe disease and recovered had higher ADCC activities than patients who had severe disease and deceased. Importantly, ADCC activities were mediated by a diversity of epitopes in SARS-COV-2-infected mice and induced to comparable levels against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) as that against the D614G mutant in human patients and vaccinated mice.

However, the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Replication-competent recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes provide valuable tools to investigate viral infection. Low levels of reporter gene expressed from previous reporter-expressing recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 in the locus of the open reading frame (ORF)7a protein have jeopardized their use to monitor the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro or in vivo. Here, we report an alternative strategy where reporter genes were placed upstream of the highly expressed viral nucleocapsid (N) gene followed by a porcine tescherovirus (PTV-1) 2A proteolytic cleavage site. The higher levels of reporter expression using this strategy resulted in efficient visualization of rSARS-CoV-2 in infected cultured cells and excised lungs or whole organism of infected K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice. Importantly, real-time viral infection was readily tracked using a noninvasive in vivo imaging system and allowed us to rapidly identify antibodies which are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Notably, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, in which a viral gene was not deleted, not only retained wild-type (WT) virus-like pathogenicity in vivo but also exhibited high stability in vitro and in vivo, supporting their use to investigate viral infection, dissemination, pathogenesis, and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.',\n",

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses.

Anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies were detected in 38/82 (46.3%) of cases with a mean age of 31 years and female HCWs constituted 57.6% of cases. The highest rate of seropositivity was from the nurses (60.5%), and physicians (31.6%) with only (7.9%) technicians. Only 28/82 (34.1%) HCWs reported previous history of COVID19. We reported a statistically significant difference in the timing of exposure (p = 0.010) and the frequency of contact with COVID-19 cases (p = 0.040) between previously infected and on-infected HCWs.

While multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays are available, no gold standard exists.\\nThis serial cross-sectional study was conducted using plasma samples from 8999 healthy blood donors between April-September 2020. Each sample was tested by four assays: Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG assay, targeting nucleocapsid (Abbott-NP) and three in-house IgG ELISA assays (targeting spike glycoprotein, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid). Seroprevalence rates were compared using multiple composite reference standards and by a series of Bayesian Latent Class Models.\\nWe found 13 unique diagnostic phenotypes; only 32 samples (0.4%) were positive by all assays. None of the individual assays resulted in seroprevalence increasing monotonically over time. In contrast, by using the results from all assays, the Bayesian Latent Class Model with informative priors predicted seroprevalence increased from 0.7% (95% credible interval (95% CrI); 0.4, 1.0%) in April/May to 0.7% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.1%) in June/July to 0.9% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.3) in August/September.

To assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of these three products in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, CDC and collaborators conducted a case-control analysis among 3,689 adults aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized at 21 U.S. hospitals across 18 states during March 11-August 15, 2021. An additional analysis compared serum antibody levels (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG) to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among 100 healthy volunteers enrolled at three hospitals 2-6 weeks after full vaccination with the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

Here, we identified a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-binding antibody, XG014, which potently neutralizes β-coronavirus lineage B (β-CoV-B), including SARS-CoV-2, its circulating variants, SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoV WIV1. Interestingly, antibody family members competing with XG014 binding show reduced levels of cross-reactivity and induce antibody-dependent SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, suggesting a unique mode of recognition by XG014. Structural analyses reveal that XG014 recognizes a conserved epitope outside the ACE2 binding site and completely locks RBD in the non-functional \"down\" conformation, while its family member XG005 directly competes with ACE2 binding and position the RBD \"up\". Single administration of XG014 is effective in protection against and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Our findings suggest the potential to develop XG014 as pan-β-CoV-B therapeutics and the importance of the XG014 conserved antigenic epitope for designing broadly protective vaccines against β-CoV-B and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.',\n",

To better understand the resistant mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of 26 antibodies to wild-type (WT) spike protein and to the protein harboring E484K mutation, respectively. The results showed that most antibodies (~85%) have weaker binding affinities to the E484K mutated spike protein than to the WT, indicating the high risk of immune evasion of the mutated virus from most of current antibodies. Binding free energy decomposition revealed that the residue E484 forms attraction with most antibodies, while the K484 has repulsion from most antibodies, which should be the main reason of the weaker binding affinities of E484K mutant to most antibodies. Impressively, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination was found to have much stronger binding affinity with E484K mutant than WT, which may work well against the mutated virus. Based on binding free energy decomposition, we predicted that the mutation of four more residues on receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, viz., F490, V483, G485 and S494, may have high risk of immune evasion, which we should pay close attention on during the development of new mAb therapeutics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Along with the nasal epithelium, the lung epithelium is a portal of entry for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and many other respiratory viruses. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus surface spike proteins bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor to facilitate entry into the respiratory epithelium. Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are committed respiratory progenitor cells responsible for the integrity and regeneration of the respiratory epithelium and production of respiratory surfactant proteins. AT2 cells express high levels of surface ACE-2 and thus are a leading target for primary infection by SARS-CoV-2. This study describes a method for directly differentiating telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized human cord blood-derived multi-lineage progenitor cells (MLPCs) to AT2-like cells for the purpose of generating an in vitro cellular platform for viral studies. Differentiation was confirmed with the acquisition of AT2 and absence of alveolar type 1 (AT1) specific markers by confocal microscopy. Expression of the ACE-2 receptor was confirmed by immunofluorescence antibody staining, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and binding of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike and spike 1 proteins. The binding of biotinylated spike proteins was specifically blocked by unlabeled spike proteins and neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the spike protein was internalized after binding to the surface membrane of the cells. The authors defined the culture conditions that enabled AT2-like cells to be repeatedly passaged and cryopreserved without further differentiation to AT1. The authors' method provides a stable and renewable source of AT2 cells for respiratory viral binding, blocking and uptake studies.\",\n",

DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The antibodies recognized and potently neutralized a panel of different Spike variants including Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Eta and A.23.1, but to a lesser extent Beta and Gamma. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co-immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the last year, mass screening campaigns have been carried out to identify immunological response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and establish a possible seroprevalence. The obtained results gained new importance with the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, as the lack of doses has persuaded several countries to introduce different policies for individuals who had a history of COVID-19. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) may represent an affordable tool to support population screening in low-middle-income countries, where diagnostic tests are lacking and epidemiology is still widely unknown. However, LFAs have demonstrated a wide range of performance, and the question of which one could be more valuable in these settings still remains. We evaluated the performance of 11 LFAs in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzing samples collected from 350 subjects. In addition, samples from 57 health care workers collected at 21 to 24\\u2009days after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were also evaluated. LFAs demonstrated a wide range of specificity (92.31% to 100%) and sensitivity (50% to 100%). The analysis of postvaccination samples was used to describe the most suitable tests to detect IgG response against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Tuberculosis (TB) therapy was identified as a potential factor affecting the specificity of LFAs. This analysis identified which LFAs represent a valuable tool not only for the detection of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection but also for the detection of IgG elicited in response to vaccination. These results demonstrated that different LFAs may have different applications and the possible risks of their use in high-TB-burden settings. ',\n",

We determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies-AZD8895 and AZD1061-which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to define the genetic and structural basis of neutralization. AZD8895 forms an 'aromatic cage' at the heavy/light chain interface using germ line-encoded residues in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals. AZD1061 has an unusually long LCDR1; the HCDR3 makes interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of AZD8895. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the crucial binding residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern with regards to virus escape from antibody-mediated neutralization. Both AZD8895 and AZD1061 have strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern with antigenic substitutions in the RBD. We conclude that germ line-encoded antibody features enable recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and demonstrate the utility of the cocktail AZD7442 in neutralizing emerging variant viruses.\",\n",

While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcαR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (FcγRIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, support the clinical use of currently available antibody-based treatment including the continued study of CCP transfusion strategies.',\n",

To understand the impact of spike protein mutations on the binding interactions required for virus infection and the effectiveness of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies, the binding activities of the original spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) sequence and the reported spike protein variants were investigated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In addition, the interactions of the ACE2 receptor, an anti-spike monoclonal antibody (mAb1), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb2), the original spike RBD sequence, and mutants D614G, N501Y, N439K, Y453F, and E484K were assessed. Compared to the original RBD, the Y453F and N501Y mutants displayed a significant increase in ACE2 binding affinity, whereas D614G had a substantial reduction in binding affinity. All mAb-RBD mutant proteins displayed a reduction in binding affinities relative to the original RBD, except for the E484K-mAb1 interaction. The potential neutralizing capability of mAb1 and mAb2 was investigated. Accordingly, mAb1 failed to inhibit the ACE2-RBD interaction and mAb2 inhibited the ACE2-RBD interactions for all RBD mutants, except mutant E484K, which only displayed partial blocking.',\n",

However, currently approved vaccines cannot meet the global demand. In addition, none of the currently used vaccines is administered intranasally to potentially induce mucosal immunity. Here, we tested the safety and immunogenicity of a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that includes a stabilized spike antigen and can be administered intranasally. The vaccine is based on a live Newcastle disease virus vector expressing a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stabilized in a prefusion conformation with six beneficial proline substitutions (AVX/COVID-12-HEXAPRO; Patria). Immunogenicity testing in the pig model showed that both intranasal and intramuscular application of the vaccine as well as a combination of the two induced strong serum neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, substantial reactivity to B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 spike variants was detected. Finally, no adverse reactions were found in the experimental animals at any dose level or delivery route. These results indicate that the experimental vaccine AVX/COVID-12-HEXAPRO (Patria) is safe and highly immunogenic in the pig model. ',\n",

The aim of this study was to assess both humoral and cellular response after a messenger RNA vaccination schedule.\\nEighty-eight consecutive cancer patients treated with programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors were enrolled from the beginning of the vaccination campaign for frail patients. Blood samples for humoral and cell-mediated immune response evaluation were obtained before vaccination (T0), before the second administration (T1) and 21 days after the second dose (T2). The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the percentage of participants showing a significant increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells, measured by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay, after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint is computed together with its exact binomial 95% confidence interval.\\nIn SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects, spike-specific T-cell response was almost undetectable at T0 [median 0.0 interferon-γ (IFN-γ) spot forming units (SFU)/million peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) interquartile range (IQR) 0-7.5] and significantly increased at T1 and T2 (median 15.0 IFN-γ SFU/million PBMC, 25th-75th 0-40 versus 90 IFN-γ SFU/million PBMC, 25th-75th 32.5-224, respectively) (P < 0.001). Focusing on naïve and experienced SARS-CoV-2 subjects, no differences were reported both in terms of CD4- and CD8-specific T-cell response, suggesting that BNT162b2 is able to elicit both adaptive responses after complete vaccination schedule, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was low at T1 in SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects [median 1 : 5 (IQR 1 : 5-1 : 20)] but reached a significantly higher median of 1 : 80 (25th-75th 1 : 20-1 : 160) at T2 (P < 0.0001). Moreover, no COVID-19 cases were documented throughout the period of study.\\nOur data have demonstrated that the administration of a full course of BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a sustained immune response against SARS-CoV-2 regardless of the type of cancer and/or the type of immune checkpoint inhibitors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants has raised concerns related to the effectiveness of vaccines and antibody therapeutics developed against the unmutated wildtype virus. Here, we examined the effect of the 12 most commonly occurring mutations in the\\xa0receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on its expression, stability, activity, and antibody escape potential. Stability was measured using thermal denaturation, and the activity and antibody escape potential were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry in terms of binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and to neutralizing human antibody CC12.1, respectively. Our results show that mutants differ in their expression levels. Of the eight best-expressed mutants, two (N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y) showed stronger affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 compared with the wildtype, whereas four (Y453F, S477N, T478I, and S494P) had similar affinity and two (K417N and E484K) had weaker affinity than the wildtype. Compared with the wildtype, four mutants (K417N, Y453F, N501Y, and K417T/E484K/N501Y) had weaker affinity for the CC12.1 antibody, whereas two (S477N and S494P) had similar affinity, and two (T478I and E484K) had stronger affinity than the wildtype. Mutants also differ in their thermal stability, with the two least stable mutants showing reduced expression. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple factors contribute toward the natural selection of variants, and all these factors need to be considered to understand the evolution of the virus. In addition, since not all variants can escape a given neutralizing antibody, antibodies to treat new variants can be chosen based on the specific mutations in that variant.',\n",

Yet, the kinetics and compositional patterns of vaccine-induced antibody responses to the original strain and emerging variants of concern remain largely unknown. Here we characterized serum antibody classes and subclasses targeting the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type and α, β, γ and δ variants in a longitudinal cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine. We found that mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response with a subclass profile comparable to that induced by natural infection. Importantly, these antibody responses targeted both wild type SARS-CoV-2 as well as its α, β, γ and δ variants. Following primary vaccination, individuals with pre-existing immunity showed higher induction of all antibodies but IgG3 compared to SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects. Unlike naïve individuals, COVID-19 recovered subjects did not mount a recall antibody response upon the second vaccine dose. In these individuals, secondary immunization resulted in a slight reduction of IgG1 against the receptor-binding domain of β and γ variants. Despite the lack of recall humoral response, vaccinees with pre-existing immunity still showed higher titers of IgG1 and IgA to all variants analyzed compared to fully vaccinated naïve individuals. Our findings indicate that mRNA-1273 vaccine triggered cross-variant antibody responses with distinct profiles in vaccinees with or without pre-existing immunity and suggest that individuals with prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection may not benefit from the second mRNA vaccine dose with the current standard regimen.',\n",

Compared with XG81, XG83 exhibited a higher RBD binding affinity and neutralization potency against wild-typed pseudovirus, variant pseudoviruses with mutated spike proteins, such as D614G, E484Q, and A475V, as well as the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. To explore potential broadly neutralizing antibodies, heavy and light chains from all 18 nAbs (16 published nAbs, XG81 and XG83) were cross-recombined, and some of the functional antibodies were screened and studied for RBD binding affinity, and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions were registered from all volunteers. Blood samples were obtained from a subset of volunteers and analyzed for humoral and cellular measures of immunogenicity.\\nThe primary adverse reaction in the 434 volunteers was pain at the injection site, with a higher incidence in the vaccine than in the placebo arm. Adverse reactions observed were mostly mild and local. No severe adverse events were reported. The humoral evaluation was performed on 81 volunteers. Seroconversion rates for specific anti-S1-RBD IgG were 86.67% in the 18-59 age group and 70.37% in the ≥60 age group, two and four weeks after the second dose.

Here, we report five X-ray crystal structures of sybodies (synthetic nanobodies) including those of binary and ternary complexes of Sb16-RBD, Sb45-RBD, Sb14-RBD-Sb68, and Sb45-RBD-Sb68, as well as unliganded Sb16. These structures reveal that Sb14, Sb16, and Sb45 bind the RBD at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface and that the Sb16 interaction is accompanied by a large conformational adjustment of complementarity-determining region 2. In contrast, Sb68 interacts at the periphery of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface. We also determined cryo-EM structures of Sb45 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Superposition of the X-ray structures of sybodies onto the trimeric spike protein cryo-EM map indicates that some sybodies may bind in both \"up\" and \"down\" configurations, but others may not. Differences in sybody recognition of several recently identified RBD variants are explained by these structures.',\n",

These variants can increase rates of virus transmission and/or increase the risk of reinfection and reduce the protection afforded by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and vaccination. These variants can therefore enable SARS-CoV-2 to continue its spread in the face of rising population immunity while maintaining or increasing its replication fitness. The identification of four rapidly expanding virus lineages since December 2020, designated variants of concern, has ushered in a new stage of the pandemic. The four variants of concern, the Alpha variant (originally identified in the UK), the Beta variant (originally identified in South Africa), the Gamma variant (originally identified in Brazil) and the Delta variant (originally identified in India), share several mutations with one another as well as with an increasing number of other recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Gilts were mock-bred at 2nd estrus with killed sperm including an intrauterine (i.u.) vaccine comprised of recombinant (r) PEDV Spike protein (rPEDVS1) and L. intracellularis flagellin (rFliC) formulated with poly I:C, host defense peptide, and polyphosphazene (TriAdj).

They also received an i.m. injection of rFliC-TriAdj at 3rd and 4th estrus to establish whether i.u. vaccination primes systemic immunity without inducing mucosal tolerance. Control gilts were administered semen alone at 2nd estrus which allowed us to compare litter weights and sizes to industry standards. Colostrum from gilts challenged with low dose PEDV plus alum was used as positive reference samples for neutralizing antibodies and passive protection. Thirteen weeks later, the i.u.-vaccinated gilts showed significant PEDVS1-specific serum, colostral, and uterine antibody titers and colostral PEDVS1-neutralizing antibodies but poor cell-mediated immunity. Piglets born to i.u. vaccinated gilts received partial passive protection from PEDV infection 3\\xa0days after birth but eventually succumbed to the disease. Immunization by the i.u./i.m. route triggered significant anti-FliC cell-mediated immunity and colostral FliC antibodies that remained high in weaned piglet serum. This trial and a repeat trial wherein gilts were immunized at 1st estrus without semen and at 2nd estrus with live semen showed that intrauterine immunization did not impact fertility, number of live births or piglet growth kinetics.

Potent antibodies recognize exposed variable epitopes, often rendering them ineffective against other sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Class 4 anti-RBD antibodies against a less-exposed, but more-conserved, cryptic epitope could recognize newly emergent zoonotic sarbecoviruses and variants, but they usually show only weak neutralization potencies.

C118-RBD and C022-RBD structures reveal orientations that extend from the cryptic epitope to occlude ACE2 binding and CDRH3-RBD main-chain H-bond interactions that extend an RBD β sheet, thus reducing sensitivity to RBD side-chain changes. A C118-spike trimer structure reveals rotated RBDs that allow access to the cryptic epitope and the potential for intra-spike crosslinking to increase avidity.

Importantly, we detected the community transmission of different P.1 lineages bearing NTD indels ∆69-70 (which can impact several SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic protocols), ∆144 and ins214ANRN, and a new VOI N.10 derived from the B.1.1.33 lineage carrying three NTD deletions (∆141-144, ∆211, and ∆256-258). These findings support that the ongoing widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil generates new viral lineages that might be more resistant to antibody neutralization than parental variants of concern.',\n",

The assay utility for the discovery of novel inhibitors was demonstrated with a panel of anti-RBD antibodies, ACE2-derived miniproteins and soluble ACE2. Studying the effect of RBD mutations on ACE2 binding showed that the N501Y mutation increased RBD apparent affinity toward ACE2 tenfold that resulted in escaping inhibition by some anti-RBD antibodies. In contrast, while E484K mutation did not highly change the binding affinity, it still escaped antibody inhibition likely due to changes in the epitope recognized by the antibody. Also, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from COVID-19 positive samples from two distinct regions (USA and Brazil) were successfully detected and the results further suggest the persistence of NAbs for at least 6\\xa0months post symptom onset. Finally, sera from vaccinated individuals were tested for NAbs and showed varying neutralizing activity after first and second doses, suggesting the assay can be used to assess immunity of vaccinated populations. Our results demonstrate the broad utility and ease of use of this methodology both for drug discovery and clinical research applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 recognizes, via its spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD), human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection. Ecto-domain protein of ACE2 can therefore function as a decoy. Here we show that mutations of S19W, T27W, and N330Y in ACE2 could individually enhance SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD binding. Y330 could be synergistically combined with either W19 or W27, whereas W19 and W27 are mutually unbeneficial. The structures of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD bound to the ACE2 mutants reveal that the enhanced binding is mainly contributed by the van der Waals interactions mediated by the aromatic side-chains from W19, W27, and Y330. While Y330 and W19/W27 are distantly located and devoid of any steric interference, W19 and W27 are shown to orient their side-chains toward each other and to cause steric conflicts, explaining their incompatibility. Finally, using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we demonstrate that these residue substitutions are associated with dramatically improved entry-inhibition efficacy toward both wild-type and antibody-resistant viruses. Taken together, our biochemical and structural data have delineated the basis for the elevated S-RBD binding associated with S19W, T27W, and N330Y mutations in ACE2, paving the way for potential application of these mutants in clinical treatment of COVID-19.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a public health crisis, and the vaccines that can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies are essential for ending the pandemic. The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer-antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S-antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S-antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S-antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S-antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S-antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S-antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.',\n",

In this study, a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate, known as pSV10-SARS-CoV-2, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was designed and tested in 39 BALB/c mice with BC01, an adjuvant derived from unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA fragments from the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin genome. Mice vaccinated with pSV10-SARS-CoV-2 with BC01 produced early neutralizing antibodies and developed stronger humoral and cellular immune responses compared to mice that received the DNA vaccine only. Moreover, sera from mice vaccinated with pSV10-SARS-CoV-2 with BC01 can neutralize certain variants, including 614G, 614G\\xa0+\\xa0472\\xa0V, 452R, 483A, 501Y.V2, and B.1.1.7.

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 is the name of the acute respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a close relative of those that caused the severe outbreaks of SARS and MERS several years ago. Since first appearance on December of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has cause extremely high levels of mortality, morbidity, global economic breakdown, and the consequent human suffering. The main diagnostic test for the confirmation of symptomatic individuals is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, serology techniques, such as ELISA are useful to measure the antibodies produced in humans after contact with the virus, as well as the direct presence of viral antigens. In this study we aim to assemble and evaluate four ELISA assays to measure the presence of IgG or IgM specific for the viral Spike protein in COVID-19 patients, using either the full recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or the fragment corresponding to the receptor binding domain. As a control, we analyzed a group of pre-pandemic serum samples obtained before 2017. Strong reactivity was observed against both antigens. A few pre-pandemic samples displayed high OD values, suggesting the possibility of some cross reactivity. All four assays show very good repeatability, both intra- and inter-assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis allowed the definition of cutoffs and evaluation of performance for each ELISA by estimation of the area under the curve. This performance parameter was high for all tests (AUC range: 0.98-0.99). Multiple comparisons between tests revealed no significant difference between each other (P values: 0.24-0.95). Our results show that both antigens are effective to detect both specific IgG and IgM antibodies, with high sensitivity (range 0.92-0.99), specificity (range 0.93-0.97) and congruence with the RT-PCR test (Cohen´s Kappa range 0.87-0.93). These assays will allow health authorities to have a new tool to estimate seroprevalence, in order to manage and improve the severe sanitary situation caused by this virus.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, adaptive solutions are needed to allow us to make fast decisions and take effective sanitation measures, e.g., the fast screening of large groups (employees, passengers, pupils, etc.). Although being reliable, most of the existing SARS-CoV-2 detection methods cannot be integrated into garments to be used on demand. Here, we report an organic field-effect transistor (OFET)-based biosensing device detecting of both SARS-CoV-2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in less than 20 min. The biosensor was produced by functionalizing an intrinsically stretchable and semiconducting triblock copolymer (TBC) film either with the anti-S1 protein antibodies (S1 Abs) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein, targeting CoV-2-specific RBDs and anti-S1 Abs, respectively. The obtained sensing platform is easy to realize due to the straightforward fabrication of the TBC film and the utilization of the reliable physical adsorption technique for the molecular immobilization. The device demonstrates a high sensitivity of about 19%/dec and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.36 fg/mL for anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies and, at the same time, a sensitivity of 32%/dec and a LOD of 76.61 pg/mL for the virus antigen detection. The TBC used as active layer is soft, has a low modulus of 24 MPa, and can be stretched up to 90% with no crack formation of the film. The TBC is compatible with roll-to-roll printing, potentially enabling the fabrication of low-cost wearable or on-skin diagnostic platforms aiming at point-of-care concepts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global pandemic of the Coronavirus disease in late 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccine development efforts have predominantly been aimed at 'Extra-viral' Spike (S) protein as vaccine vehicles, but there are concerns regarding 'viral immune escape' since multiple mutations may enable the mutated virus strains to escape from immunity against S protein. The 'Intra-viral' Nucleocapsid (N-protein) is relatively conserved among mutant strains of coronaviruses during spread and evolution. Herein, we demonstrate novel vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 by using the whole conserved N-protein or its fragment/peptides. Using ELISA assay, we showed that high titers of specific anti-N antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM) were maintained for a reasonably long duration (> 5 months), suggesting that N-protein is an excellent immunogen to stimulate host immune system and robust B-cell activation. We synthesized three peptides located at the conserved regions of N-protein among CoVs. One peptide showed as a good immunogen for vaccination as well. Cytokine arrays on post-vaccination mouse sera showed progressive up-regulation of various cytokines such as IFN-γ and CCL5, suggesting that TH1 associated responses are also stimulated. Furthermore, vaccinated mice exhibited an elevated memory T cells population. Here, we propose an unconventional vaccine strategy targeting the conserved N-protein as an alternative vaccine target for coronaviruses. Moreover, we generated a mouse monoclonal antibody specifically against an epitope shared between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and we are currently developing the First-in-Class humanized anti-N-protein antibody to potentially treat patients infected by various CoVs in the future.\",\n",

This synergy is epitope specific and is not observed for a second high-affinity nanobody against a non-conserved epitope in the receptor-binding domain. Importantly, a hexavalent VHH-72 nanobody retains binding to spike proteins from multiple highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) and potently neutralizes them. Multivalent VHH-72 nanobodies also display drug-like biophysical properties, including high stability, high solubility, and low levels of non-specific binding. The unique neutralizing and biophysical properties of VHH-72 multivalent nanobodies make them attractive as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an outbreak of a pandemic worldwide. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent entry into cells. Mutations in the spike protein (S) are of particular interest due to their potential for reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies or increasing the viral transmissibility and infectivity. Recently, many mutations in the spike protein released new variants, including the Delta and Kappa ones (known as the Indian variants). The variants Delta and Kappa are now of most recent concern because of their well-increased infectivity, both a spin-off of the B.1.617 lineage, which was first identified in India in October 2020. This study employed homology modeling to probe the potential structural effects of the mutations. It was found that the mutations, Leu452Arg, Thr478Lys, and Glu484Gln in the spike protein\\xa0increase the affinity for the hACE2 receptor, which explains the greater infectivity of the SARS-Cov-2 B.1.617 (Indian Variant).',\n",

The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

The spike receptor-binding motif mediates recognition of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a critical step in infection, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Posttranslational modifications of the spike receptor-binding motif have been shown to modulate viral infectivity and host immune response, but these modifications are still being explored. Here we studied asparagine deamidation of the spike protein, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, which affect both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 in the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-life of 16.5 and 123\\xa0days at 37 °C, respectively. Deamidation is significantly slowed at 4 °C, indicating a strong dependence of spike protein molecular aging on environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor more than 3.5-fold, yet its high conservation pattern suggests some positive effect on viral fitness. We propose a model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrating how deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif could lead to the accumulation on the virion surface of a nonnegligible chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for molecular aging of the spike protein with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development.',\n",

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness in 10-15% of infected individuals and mortality in 2-3%. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and to contain viral spread. Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the \"cold chain\" transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS-CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development. Finally, our vaccination regimens generated neutralizing antibodies that partially cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Reverse vaccinology is an evolving approach for improving vaccine effectiveness and minimizing adverse responses by limiting immunizations to critical epitopes. Towards this goal, we sought to identify immunogenic amino acid motifs and linear epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that elicit IgG in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients. Paired pre/post vaccination samples from N = 20 healthy adults, and post-vaccine samples from an additional N = 13 individuals were used to immunoprecipitate IgG targets expressed by a bacterial display random peptide library, and preferentially recognized peptides were mapped to the spike primary sequence. The data identify several distinct amino acid motifs recognized by vaccine-induced IgG, a subset of those targeted by IgG from natural infection, which may mimic 3-dimensional conformation (mimotopes). Dominant linear epitopes were identified in the C-terminal domains of the S1 and S2 subunits (aa 558-569, 627-638, and 1148-1159) which have been previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in vitro and demonstrate identity to bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, but limited homology to non-pathogenic human coronavirus. The identified COVID-19 mRNA vaccine epitopes should be considered in the context of variants, immune escape and vaccine and therapy design moving forward.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Successful control of emerging infectious diseases requires accelerated development of fast, affordable, and accessible assays for wide implementation at a high frequency. This paper presents a design for an in-solution assay pipeline, featuring nanobody-functionalized nanoparticles for rapid, electronic detection (Nano2RED) of Ebola and COVID-19 antigens. Synthetic nanobody binders with high affinity, specificity, and stability are selected from a combinatorial library and site-specifically conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Without requiring any fluorescent labelling, washing, or enzymatic amplification, these multivalent AuNP sensors reliably transduce antigen binding signals upon mixing into physical AuNP aggregation and sedimentation processes, displaying antigen-dependent optical extinction readily detectable by spectrometry or portable electronic circuitry. With Ebola virus secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as targets, Nano2RED showed a high sensitivity (the limit of detection of ∼10\\xa0pg /mL, or 0.13 pM for sGP and ∼40\\xa0pg/mL, or ∼1.3 pM for RBD in diluted human serum), a high specificity, a large dynamic range (∼7 logs),and fast readout within minutes. The rapid detection, low material cost (estimated <$0.01 per test), inexpensive and portable readout system (estimated <$5), and digital data output, make Nano2RED a particularly accessible assay in screening of patient samples towards successful control of infectious diseases.',\n",

(2) Methods: 116 cancer patients and 35 healthy participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The interval between the first and second doses were closely matched during analysis. IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). (3) Results: Following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (including BNT162b2, AZD1222, and mRNA-1273), the mean serum anti-spike protein antibody level was 382.4 BAU/mL (binding antibody unit, SD ± 9.4) in the control group, 265.8 BAU/mL (±145.7) in solid cancer patients, and 168.2 BAU/mL (±172.9) in hematological cancer patients.

For example, detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies could serve as the basis for an \"immunity passport\" that would enable individuals to travel internationally. Here, utilizing a novel Magnetic Modulation Biosensing (MMB) system and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we demonstrate a highly sensitive and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG serological assay.

Compared with ELISA, the MMB-based assay has an ~6-fold lower limit of detection (129 ng/L vs. 817 ng/L), and it detects an increase in the IgG concentration much earlier after vaccination. Using 85 RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and 79 -negative samples, the MMB-based assay demonstrated similar clinical specificity (98% vs. 99%) and sensitivity (93% vs. 92%) to the ELISA test, but with a much faster turnaround time (45 min vs. 245 min). The high analytical and clinical sensitivity, short turnaround time, and simplicity of the MMB-based assay makes it a preferred method for antibody detection.',\n",
