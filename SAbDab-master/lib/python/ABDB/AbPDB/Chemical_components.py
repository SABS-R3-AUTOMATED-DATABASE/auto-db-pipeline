Analyse the chemical component dictionary
http://www.wwpdb.org/ccd.html

These are the types of chemical components in the pdb: ( grep "_chem_comp.type" components.cif | cut -c 50-120 | sort | uniq )

We will bin them into:

peptide:
    "D-beta-peptide, C-gamma linking" 
    "D-gamma-peptide, C-delta linking" 
    "D-peptide linking" 
    "D-PEPTIDE LINKING" 
    "D-peptide NH3 amino terminus" 
    "D-PEPTIDE NH3 AMINO TERMINUS" 
    "L-beta-peptide, C-gamma linking" 
    "L-gamma-peptide, C-delta linking" 
    "L-peptide COOH carboxy terminus" 
    "L-PEPTIDE COOH CARBOXY TERMINUS" 
    "L-peptide linking" 
    "L-PEPTIDE LINKING" 
    "L-peptide NH3 amino terminus" 
    peptide-like 
    PEPTIDE-LIKE 
    "peptide linking" 
    "PEPTIDE LINKING" 

nucleic-acid:
    "DNA linking" 
    "DNA LINKING" 
    "DNA OH 3 prime terminus" 
    "DNA OH 3 PRIME TERMINUS" 
    "L-DNA LINKING"
    "L-RNA LINKING"
    "RNA linking" 
    "RNA LINKING" 
    "RNA OH 3 prime terminus" 

saccharide:
    D-saccharide 
    D-SACCHARIDE 
    "D-saccharide 1,4 and 1,4 linking" 
    "D-SACCHARIDE 1,4 AND 1,4 LINKING" 
    L-saccharide 
    L-SACCHARIDE 
    "L-SACCHARIDE 1,4 AND 1,4 LINKING"
    saccharide 
    SACCHARIDE

non-polymer:
    non-polymer 
    NON-POLYMER 

This has been done in resname_to_type


Common buffers/molecules in the PDB which are unlikely to be hapten antigens 

Method 1:
    This list was taken from the supplementary material (Table 2) of:
    Visualizing ligand molecules in twilight electron density. C. X. Weichenberger, E. Pozharski and B. Rupp. Acta Cryst. (2013). F69, 195-200.
    
    Acknowledgement -  Anthony's JC 03/04/13

Method 2:

    The list of chemical component code to pdb code was taken from:
    http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/ld-download.html
    Saved as: ./Antibody/AbPDB/dat/Resources/cc-to-pdb.tdd.txt
    
    We look at the number of structures with each code.
    Distribution of number of pdb codes with the chemical component found at:
    ./Antibody/AbPDB/dat/Resources/Frequency_of_cc_in_pdb.pdf
    
    We use the cut-off of 15. (and manually examine those which are over but under 50 and have mainly known Antibodies - just in case it's a pet hapten antigen)
    
    This is a harsh cut off! This is fine for analysing antibodies (as you are unlikely to have more than 15 bound to the same ag). However, change the cutoff for other purposes (suggest at least 200 for "common")
    
    There is still a problem if there is a rarely used code or a newly introduced code for buffer.
    
    fix 120613 will chemical component dict api - runs to online database if cannot find it - obviously requires web access. 
    
    Acknowledgement - JP for suggesting the method.
    The following have been removed from the list as they are either common sugar or peptides
        BGC saccharide  
        NAG saccharide
        XYP saccharide
        XYS saccharide
        MAL saccharide
        MAN saccharide
        GLA saccharide
        GLC saccharide
        A2G saccharide
        LMT saccharide
        PE1 peptide
        F6P saccharide
        DPN peptide
        GAL saccharide
        BOG saccharide
        NGA saccharide
        FUC saccharide
        BMA saccharide
        SUC saccharide
        FUL saccharide
        NDG saccharide

I have updated method 1 list with method 2 list

It is left as a dictionary of dictionaries if we decide to add annotations
    
    
Functions provided are:

is_aa 
is_common_buffer
is_carbohydrate
is_nucleic_acid
is_polymer
get_type
get_chemical_name

each take either a three letter code or a residue object as argument
