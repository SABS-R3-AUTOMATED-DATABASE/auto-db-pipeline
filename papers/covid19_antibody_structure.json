Nucleocapsid protein is a major structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 that plays important roles in the viral RNA packing, replication, assembly, and infection. Here, we report two crystal structures of nucleocapsid protein C-terminal domain (CTD) at resolutions of 2.0 Å and 3.1 Å, respectively. These two structures, crystallized under different conditions, contain 2 and 12 CTDs in asymmetric unit, respectively. Interestingly, despite different crystal packing, both structures show a similar dimeric form as the smallest unit, consistent with its solution form measured by the size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting an important role of CTD in the dimerization of nucleocapsid proteins. By analyzing the surface charge distribution, we identified a stretch of positively charged residues between Lys257 and Arg262 that are involved in RNA-binding. Through screening a single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) library, we identified four sdAbs targeting different regions of nucleocapsid protein with high affinities that have future potential to be used in viral detection and therapeutic purposes.', 'journal': 'The FEBS journal', 'date': '2021-10-20', 'authors': ['ZhenghuJia', 'ChenLiu', 'YuewenChen', 'HengJiang', 'ZijingWang', 'JialuYao', 'JieYang', 'JiaxinZhu', 'BoqingZhang', 'ZhiguangYuchi'], 'doi': '10.1111/febs.16239'}
{'title': 'Structure-Function Analysis of Resistance to Bamlanivimab by SARS-CoV-2 Variants Kappa, Delta, and Lambda.', 'abstract': "The newly emerging Kappa, Delta, and Lambda SARS-CoV-2 variants are worrisome, characterized with the double mutations E484Q/L452R, T478K/L452R, and F490S/L452Q, respectively, in their receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the spike proteins. As revealed in crystal structures, most of these residues (e.g., 452 and 484 in RBDs) are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, these mutations might not significantly affect RBD's binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without knowing the molecular mechanism, these successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) may be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, here, we show that the E484Q/L452R mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between the RBD of the Kappa variant and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab), which was efficacious for neutralizing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. To verify simulation results, we further carried out experiments with both pseudovirions- and live virus-based neutralization assays and demonstrated that LY-CoV555 completely lost neutralizing activity against the L452R/E484Q mutant. Similarly, we show that mutations in the Delta and Lambda variants can also destabilize the RBD's binding with LY-CoV555. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how these variants evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precise mixing of antibodies can be achieved as a cocktail treatment for patients infected with these variants.", 'journal': 'Journal of chemical information and modeling', 'date': '2021-10-15', 'authors': ['ShufengLiu', 'TienHuynh', 'Charles BStauft', 'Tony TWang', 'BinquanLuan'], 'doi': '10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01058'}

Much of this response has focused, appropriately, on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, and in particular the binding of the spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and subsequent membrane fusion. This Review provides the structural and cellular foundations for understanding the multistep SARS-CoV-2 entry process, including S protein synthesis, S protein structure, conformational transitions necessary for association of the S protein with ACE2, engagement of the receptor-binding domain of the S protein with ACE2, proteolytic activation of the S protein, endocytosis and membrane fusion. We define the roles of furin-like proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in these processes, and delineate the features of ACE2 orthologues in reservoir animal species and S protein adaptations that facilitate efficient human transmission.

{'title': 'A large-scale computational screen identifies strong potential inhibitors for disrupting SARS-CoV-2\u2009S-protein and human ACE2 interaction.', 'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of individuals across the globe and has killed over 2.7 million people. Even though vaccines against this virus have recently been introduced, the antibody generated in the process has been reported to decline quickly. This can reduce the efficacy of vaccines over time and can result in re-infections. Thus, drugs that are effective against COVID-19 can provide a second line of defence and can prevent occurrence of the severe form of the disease. The interaction between SARS-CoV2\u2009S-protein and human ACE2 (hACE2) is essential for the infection of the virus. Thus, drugs that block this interaction could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection into the host cells. To identify such drugs, we first analyzed the recently published crystal structure of S-protein-hACE2 complex and identified essential residues of both S-protein and hACE2 for this interaction. We used this knowledge to virtually dock a drug library containing 4115 drug molecules against S-protein for repurposing drugs that could inhibit binding of S-protein to hACE2. We identified several potential inhibitors based on their docking scores, pharmacological effects and ability to block residues of S protein required for interaction with hACE2. The top inhibitors included drugs used for the treatment of hepatitis C (velpatasvir, pibrentasvir) as well as several vitamin D derivatives. Several molecules obtained from our screen already have good experimental support in published literature.

{'title': 'The allosteric modulation of complement C5 by knob domain peptides.', 'abstract': 'Bovines have evolved a subset of antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining regions that harbour cysteine-rich knob domains. To produce high-affinity peptides, we previously isolated autonomous 3-6 kDa knob domains from bovine antibodies. Here, we show that binding of four knob domain peptides elicits a range of effects on the clinically validated drug target complement C5. Allosteric mechanisms predominated, with one peptide selectively inhibiting C5 cleavage by the alternative pathway C5 convertase, revealing a targetable mechanistic difference between the classical and alternative pathway C5 convertases. Taking a hybrid biophysical approach, we present C5-knob domain co-crystal structures and, by solution methods, observed allosteric effects propagating >50 Å from the binding sites. This study expands the therapeutic scope of C5, presents new inhibitors, and introduces knob domains as new, low molecular weight antibody fragments, with therapeutic potential.\nAntibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can selectively bind to other molecules and modify their behaviour. Cows are highly equipped at fighting-off disease-causing microbes due to the unique shape of some of their antibodies. Unlike other jawed vertebrates, cows’ antibodies contain an ultra-long loop region that contains a ‘knob domain’ which sticks out from the rest of the antibody. Recent research has shown that when detached, the knob domain behaves like an antibody fragment, and can independently bind to a range of different proteins. Antibody fragments are commonly developed in the laboratory to target proteins associated with certain diseases, such as arthritis and cancer. But it was unclear whether the knob domains from cows’ antibodies could also have therapeutic potential. To investigate this, Macpherson et al. studied how knob domains attach to complement C5, a protein in the inflammatory pathway which is a drug target for various diseases, including severe COVID-19. The experiments identified various knob domains that bind to complement C5 and inhibits its activity by altering its structure or movement. Further tests studying the structure of these interactions, led to the discovery of a common mechanism by which inhibitors can modify the behaviour of this inflammatory protein. Complement C5 is involved in numerous molecular pathways in the immune system, which means many of the drugs developed to inhibit its activity can also leave patients vulnerable to infection. However, one of the knob domains identified by Macpherson et al. was found to reduce the activity of complement C5 in some pathways, whilst leaving other pathways intact.

Crystal structural comparisons reveal differences in the angles of approach to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the size of the buried surface areas, and the key binding residues on the RBD of the viral spike glycoprotein. One antibody, P2C-1F11, most closely mimics binding of receptor ACE2, displays the most potent neutralizing activity in vitro and conferred strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice. It also occupies the largest binding surface and demonstrates the highest binding affinity to RBD. More interestingly, P2C-1F11 triggers rapid and extensive shedding of S1 from the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein, with only minimal such effect by the remaining two antibodies.

This review summarizes recent studies on the structure and function of spike glycoprotein, which revealed the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nSARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting 'up' or 'down' conformations, and the RBD 'down' to 'up' conformational change is required for ACE2 binding.

{'title': 'Mechanistic Insights to the Binding of Antibody CR3022 Against RBD from SARS-CoV and HCoV-19/SARS-CoV-2: A Computational Study.', 'abstract': "Aims & Objective: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently in a global outbreak. COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to public health and economic stability worldwide. CR3022, a human monoclonal neutralizing antibody isolated from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) recovery patient, was confirmed to be able to bind the S protein of HCoV-19 with a certain degree of neutralizing activity. Crystal structural information indicated that CR3022 could bind to the epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-19, whose epitope consists of 28 amino acids, and 24 of them are conserved in SARS-CoV of SARS. However, the crystal structure is only a static conformation at a certain moment in time, and it cannot provide dynamic details of the interaction between antigen and antibody.\nIn this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with MM/PBSA and CAS methods were performed to investigate the mechanism of binding of CR3022 against SARS-CoVRBD and HCoV-19-RBD in order to determine their holographic dynamic information.\nIt was found that the CR3022-SARS-CoV-RBD complex was more stable during 100ns MD run than that of the CR3022-HCoV-19-RBD system. There were common conservative amino acids on the β2 sheet of RBD, including Tyr369, Phe377, Lys378, Tyr380, Gly381, Lys386, Leu390 and others. These conservative amino acids play significant roles in the binding process of CR3022 antibody against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD. It was also found that the binding mode of CR3022 to its native target SARS-CoV-RBD is more comprehensive and uniform. Moreover, the β2 sheet residue Thr385 and non-β2 sheet residues Arg408 and Asp428 of the CR3022-SARS-CoV-RBD system were found to be crucial for their binding affinities, thus forming a special conformational epitope. However, these key amino acids are not present in the CR3022-HCoV-19-RBD system. The binding mode of CR3022 and HCoV-19-RBD is similar to that of SARS-CoV-RBD, but the deficiency of crucial hydrogen-bonds and salt-bridges. Therefore, the binding of CR3022 and HCoV-19-RBD only draws on the partial mode of the binding of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-RBD, so there is a loss of affinity.\nThus, in order to better fight the epidemic of COVID-19 with the CR3022 antibody, this antibody needs to further improve the neutralization efficiency of HCoV-19 through mutation of it's CDR region.", 'journal': 'Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening', 'date': '2020-10-28', 'authors': ['WeiYu', 'XiaominWu', 'JiayiRen', 'XiaochunZhang', 'YuemingWang', 'ChengmingLi', 'WenwenXu', 'JasonLi', 'GangLi', 'WeihongZheng', 'HuaxinLiao', 'XiaohuiYuan'], 'doi': '10.2174/1386207323666201026160500'}

This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-06-09', 'authors': ['M GordonJoyce', 'Rajeshwer SSankhala', 'Wei-HungChen', 'MisookChoe', 'HongjunBai', 'AgnesHajduczki', 'LianyingYan', 'Spencer LSterling', 'Caroline EPeterson', 'Ethan CGreen', 'ClaytonSmith', 'Nataliade Val', 'MihretAmare', 'PaulScott', 'Eric DLaing', 'Christopher CBroder', 'MorganeRolland', 'Nelson LMichael', 'KayvonModjarrad'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.03.15.992883'}

There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS-CoVs and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoVs), the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies, and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report two high-resolution crystal structures of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU.

{'title': 'Structural and Functional Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Using Human ACE2.', 'abstract': 'The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China has caused significant public health concerns. Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) spike (S) protein in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), which reveals a hACE2-binding mode similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV. However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2\xa0S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These findings shed light on the viral pathogenesis and provide important structural information regarding development of therapeutic countermeasures against the emerging virus.', 'journal': 'Cell', 'date': '2020-04-11', 'authors': ['QihuiWang', 'YanfangZhang', 'LiliWu', 'ShengNiu', 'ChunliSong', 'ZengyuanZhang', 'GuangwenLu', 'ChengpengQiao', 'YuHu', 'Kwok-YungYuen', 'QishengWang', 'HuanZhou', 'JinghuaYan', 'JianxunQi'], 'doi': '10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045'}
{'title': 'A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.', 'abstract': 'The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic, but there is currently very little understanding of the antigenicity of the virus. We therefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein at 3.1-angstrom resolution. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding epitope can only be accessed by CR3022 when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the "up" conformation and slightly rotated.
