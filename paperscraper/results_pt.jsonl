{'title': 'A large-scale systematic survey of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reveals recurring molecular features.', 'abstract': 'In the past two years, the global research in combating COVID-19 pandemic has led to isolation and characterization of numerous human antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike. This enormous collection of antibodies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the antibody response to a single antigen. From mining information derived from 88 research publications and 13 patents, we have assembled a dataset of âˆ¼8,000 human antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike from >200 donors. Analysis of antibody targeting of different domains of the spike protein reveals a number of common (public) responses to SARS-CoV-2, exemplified via recurring IGHV/IGK(L)V pairs, CDR H3 sequences, IGHD usage, and somatic hypermutation. We further present a proof-of-concept for prediction of antigen specificity using deep learning to differentiate sequences of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and to influenza hemagglutinin. Overall, this study not only provides an informative resource for antibody and vaccine research, but fundamentally advances our molecular understanding of public antibody responses to a viral pathogen.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-12-08', 'authors': ['YiquanWang', 'MengYuan', 'JianPeng', 'Ian AWilson', 'Nicholas CWu'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.11.26.470157'}
{'title': 'Omicron (B.1.1.529): Infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance.', 'abstract': "The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine-breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may be twice more likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However, its impact on Regeneron mAb cocktail appears to be mild.", 'journal': 'ArXiv', 'date': '2021-12-08', 'authors': ['JiahuiChen', 'RuiWang', 'Nancy BenovichGilby', 'Guo-WeiWei'], 'doi': None}
{'title': 'Stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain by Protein Core Redesign and Deep Mutational Scanning.', 'abstract': 'Stabilizing antigenic proteins as vaccine immunogens or diagnostic reagents is a stringent case of protein engineering and design as the exterior surface must maintain recognition by receptor(s) and antigen-specific antibodies at multiple distinct epitopes. This is a challenge, as stability-enhancing mutations must be focused on the protein core, whereas successful computational stabilization algorithms typically select mutations at solvent-facing positions. In this study we report the stabilization of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 Spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) using a combination of deep mutational scanning and computational design, including the FuncLib algorithm. Our most successful design encodes I358F, Y365W, T430I, and I513L RBD mutations, maintains recognition by the receptor ACE2 and a panel of different anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, is between 1-2°C more thermally stable than the original RBD using a thermal shift assay, and is less proteolytically sensitive to chymotrypsin and thermolysin than the original RBD.

{'title': 'BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection of human iPS cell-derived kidney podocytes.', 'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The disease has caused more than 5.1 million deaths worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are frequently the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood.\nIn this study, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes. We studied uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as pseudotyped viral particles by human iPS cell derived podocytes using qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes (including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33) associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing.\nInfection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes.\nThese results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes \nMany patients with COVID19 disease exhibit multiorgan complications, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can extend beyond the respiratory system. Acute kidney injury is a common COVID-19 complication contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Still, SARS-Cov-2 affinity for specialized kidney cells remain less clear. By leveraging our protocol for stem cell differentiation, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney glomerular podocytes by using multiple Spike-binding proteins including ACE2 and BSG/CD147. Our results also indicate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause podocyte cell death and foot process effacement, a hallmark of podocytopathies including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

{'title': 'SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response is Associated with Age in Convalescent Outpatients.', 'abstract': 'COVID-19 has had an unprecedented global impact on human health. Understanding the antibody memory responses to infection is one tool needed to effectively control the pandemic. Among 173 outpatients who had virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated serum antibody concentrations, microneutralization activity, and enumerated SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells in convalescent blood specimens. Serum antibody concentrations were variable, allowing for stratification of the cohort into high and low responders. Serum antibody concentration was positively associated with microneutralization activity and participant age, with participants under the age of 30 showing the lowest antibody level. Neither participant sex, the timing of blood sampling following the onset of illness, nor the number of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific B cells correlated with serum antibody concentration. These data suggest that young adult outpatients did not generate as robust antibody memory, compared with older adults. Further, serum antibody concentration or neutralizing activity trended but did not significantly correlate with the number of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells. These findings have direct implications for public health policy and current vaccine efforts.

{'title': 'Anti-membrane and anti-spike antibodies are long-lasting and together discriminate between past COVID-19 infection and vaccination.', 'abstract': 'The consequences of past COVID-19 infection for personal health and long-term population immunity are only starting to be revealed. Unfortunately, detecting past infection is currently a challenge, limiting clinical and research endeavors. Widely available anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests cannot differentiate between past infection and vaccination given vaccine-induced anti-spike antibodies and the rapid loss of infection-induced anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. Anti-membrane antibodies develop after COVID-19, but their long-term persistence is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that anti-membrane IgG is a sensitive and specific marker of past COVID-19 infection and persists at least one year. We also confirm that anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) Ig is a long-lasting, sensitive, and specific marker of past infection and vaccination, while anti-nucleocapsid IgG lacks specificity and quickly declines after COVID-19.

The spike proteins of B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 variants have several substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD), including L452R+E484Q, L452R+T478K, and K417N+L452R+T478K, respectively, that could potentially reduce effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and current vaccines. Here we compared B.1.617 variants, and their single and double RBD substitutions for resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Pseudoviruses with the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 spike showed a modest 1.5 to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for pseudoviruses with C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 spikes, but seven- and sixteen-fold reduction for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, was seen for pseudoviruses with the B.1.351 spike. Four of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses due to the L452R substitution, whereas six of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 pseudoviruses due to either the E484Q or L452R substitution. Against AY.1 pseudoviruses, the L452R and K417N substitutions accounted for the loss of neutralization by four antibodies and one antibody, respectively, whereas one antibody lost potency that could not be fully accounted for by a single RBD substitution. The modest resistance of B.1.617 variants to vaccine-elicited sera suggest that current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants, but the therapeutic antibodies need to be carefully selected based on their resistance profiles. Finally, the spike proteins of B.1.617 variants are more efficiently cleaved due to the P681R substitution, and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-11-19', 'authors': ['Sabari NathNeerukonda', 'RussellVassell', 'SabrinaLusvarghi', 'RichardWang', 'FernandoEchegaray', 'LisaBentley', 'Ann EEakin', 'Karl JErlandson', 'Leah CKatzelnick', 'Carol DWeiss', 'WeiWang'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.11.05.467523'}

Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging we report the effects of ACE2 and antibody binding on the conformational dynamics of S from the Wuhan-1 strain and the B.1 variant (D614G). We find that D614G modulates the energetics of the RBD position in a manner similar to ACE2 binding. We also find that antibodies that target diverse epitopes, including those distal to the RBD, stabilize the RBD in a position competent for ACE2 binding.

Here, we show that a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies against AngII, whose presence correlates with lower blood oxygenation, blood pressure dysregulation, and overall higher disease severity. Anti-AngII antibodies can develop upon specific immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike or RBD, to which they can cross-bind, suggesting some epitope mimicry between AngII and Spike/RBD.

In this observational study of mucosal and systemic humoral immunity in acutely infected, convalescent, and vaccinated subjects, we tested for cross reactivity against endemic CoV spike (S) protein at subdomain resolution. Elevated responses, particularly to the β-CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross react. While further research is needed to discern whether this recalled response is desirable or detrimental, the boosted antibodies principally targeted the better conserved S2 subdomain of the viral spike and were not associated with neutralization activity. In contrast, vaccination with a stabilized spike mRNA vaccine did not robustly boost cross-reactive antibodies, suggesting differing antigenicity and immunogenicity. In sum, this study provides evidence that antibodies targeting endemic CoV are robustly boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not to vaccination with stabilized S, and that depending on conformation or other factors, the S2 subdomain of the spike protein triggers a rapidly recalled, IgG-dominated response that lacks neutralization activity.', 'journal': 'medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences', 'date': '2021-11-04', 'authors': ['Andrew RCrowley', 'HariniNatarajan', 'Andrew PHederman', 'Carly ABobak', 'Joshua AWeiner', 'WendyWieland-Alter', 'JiwonLee', 'Evan MBloch', 'Aaron A RTobian', 'Andrew DRedd', 'Joel NBlankson', 'DanaWolf', 'TessaGoetghebuer', 'ArnaudMarchant', 'Ruth IConnor', 'Peter FWright', 'Margaret EAckerman'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.27.21265574'}

Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential escape mutations by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue.\nIndividuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination.\nThe finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI138709 (PI Overbaugh) and AI146028 (PI Matsen).

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is vaccinated.

We showed that the open conformation favors viral potency by exposing the RBD for receptor binding and viral entry, while the closed conformation supports viral immune evasion by hiding the RBD from neutralizing antibodies.

While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcαR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (FcγRIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells.

{'title': 'Epistasis at the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Interface and the Propitiously Boring Implications for Vaccine Escape.', 'abstract': 'At the time of this writing, August 2021, potential emergence of vaccine escape variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a grave global concern. The interface between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the host receptor (ACE2) overlap with the binding site of principal neutralizing antibodies (NAb), limiting the repertoire of viable mutations. Nonetheless, variants with multiple mutations in the RBD have rose to dominance. Non-additive, epistatic relationships among RBD mutations are apparent, and assessing the impact of such epistasis on the mutational landscape is crucial. Epistasis can substantially increase the risk of vaccine escape and cannot be completely characterized through the study of the wild type (WT) alone. We employed protein structure modeling using Rosetta to compare the effects of all single mutants at the RBD-NAb and RBD-ACE2 interfaces for the WT, Gamma (417T, 484K, 501Y), and Delta variants (452R, 478K). Overall, epistasis at the RBD surface appears to be limited and the effects of most multiple mutations are additive. Epistasis at the Delta variant interface weakly stabilizes NAb interaction relative to ACE2, whereas in the Gamma variant, epistasis more substantially destabilizes NAb interaction. These results suggest that the repertoire of potential escape mutations for the Delta variant is not substantially different from that of the WT, whereas Gamma poses a moderately greater risk for enhanced vaccine escape. Thus, the modest ensemble of mutations relative to the WT shown to reduce vaccine efficacy might constitute the majority of all possible escape mutations.\nPotential emergence of vaccine escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 is arguably the most pressing problem during the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines are distributed worldwide. We employed a computational approach to assess the risk of antibody escape resulting from mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the Gamma and Delta variants. The results indicate that emergence of escape mutants is somewhat less likely for the Delta variant than for the wild type and moderately more likely for the Gamma variant. We conclude that the small set of escape-enhancing mutations already identified for the wild type is likely to include the majority of all possible mutations with this effect, a welcome finding.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-09-09', 'authors': ['Nash DRochman', 'GuilhemFaure', 'Yuri IWolf', 'Peter LFreddolino', 'FengZhang', 'Eugene VKoonin'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.30.458225'}

Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together, this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and has implications for future booster strategies.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-09-01', 'authors': ['Rishi RGoel', 'Mark MPainter', 'Sokratis AApostolidis', 'DivijMathew', 'WenzhaoMeng', 'Aaron MRosenfeld', 'Kendall ALundgreen', 'ArnoldReynaldi', 'David SKhoury', 'AjinkyaPattekar', 'SigridGouma', 'LeticiaKuri-Cervantes', 'PhilipHicks', 'SarahDysinger', 'AmandaHicks', 'HarshSharma', 'SarahHerring', 'ScottKorte', 'Amy EBaxter', 'Derek AOldridge', 'Josephine RGiles', 'Madison EWeirick', 'Christopher MMcAllister', 'MosesAwofolaju', 'NicoleTanenbaum', 'Elizabeth MDrapeau', 'JeanetteDougherty', 'ShereaLong', "KurtD'Andrea", 'Jacob THamilton', 'MauraMcLaughlin', 'Justine CWilliams', 'SharonAdamski', 'OlivaKuthuru', 'NoneNone', 'IanFrank', 'Michael RBetts', 'Laura AVella', 'AlbaGrifoni', 'DanielaWeiskopf', 'AlessandroSette', 'Scott EHensley', 'Miles PDavenport', 'PaulBates', 'Eline TLuning Prak', 'Allison RGreenplate', 'E JohnWherry'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.23.457229'}
{'title': 'Effects of Spike Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern on Human or Animal ACE2-Mediated Virus Entry and Neutralization.', 'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans and a wide range of animal species. Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization.\nCells stably expressing ACE2 from various animals and a lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus assay were established to study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

We found that sera from Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remain high reactivity toward the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Delta variant while it drops dramatically toward that of Lambda variant. Interestingly, the overall titer of antibodies of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinated individuals drops 3-fold after 6 months, which could be one of major reasons for breakthrough infections, emphasizing the importance of potential third boost shot. While a therapeutic antibody, Bamlanivimab, decreases binding affinity to Delta variant by ~20 fold, it fully lost binding to Lambda variant.

We collected paired longitudinal blood and respiratory tract samples (endotracheal aspirate, sputum or pleural fluid) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 controls. Cellular, humoral and cytokine responses were analysed and correlated with clinical data. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA and multiplex assay in both the respiratory tract and blood of COVID-19 patients, although a higher receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM and IgG seroconversion level was found in respiratory specimens. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity in respiratory samples was detected only when high levels of RBD-specific antibodies were present. Strikingly, cytokine/chemokine levels and profiles greatly differed between respiratory samples and plasma, indicating that inflammation needs to be assessed in respiratory specimens for the accurate assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology. Diverse immune cell subsets were detected in respiratory samples, albeit dominated by neutrophils. Importantly, we also showed that dexamethasone and/or remdesivir treatment did not affect humoral responses in blood of COVID-19 patients.

Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care (POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test (HAT) that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization (EUA) demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting.

There is a need to determine whether such assays can predict immunity, as antibody levels wane and viral variants emerge.\nWe measured antibodies in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients using several high-throughput serological tests and functional neutralization assays. The effects of time and spike protein sequence variation on the performance and predictive value of the various assays was assessed.\nNeutralizing antibody titers decreased over the first few months post-infection but stabilized thereafter, at about 30% of the level observed shortly after infection. Serological assays commonly used to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 displayed a range of sensitivities that declined to varying extents over time. Quantitative measurements generated by serological assays based on the spike protein were better at predicting neutralizing antibody titers than assays based on nucleocapsid, but performance was variable and manufacturer positivity thresholds were not able to predict the presence or absence of detectable neutralizing activity. Even though there was some deterioration in correlation between serological measurements and functional neutralization activity, some assays maintained an ability to predict neutralizing titers, even against variants of concern.\nThe ability of high throughput serological assays to predict neutralizing antibody titers is likely crucial for evaluation of immunity at the population scale.

{'title': 'Evidence for Deleterious Antigenic Imprinting in SARS-CoV-2 Immune Response.', 'abstract': 'A previous report demonstrated the strong association between the presence of antibodies binding to an epitope region from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, termed Ep9, and COVID-19 disease severity. Patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies (Abs) had hallmarks of antigenic imprinting (AIM), including early IgG upregulation and cytokine-associated injury. Thus, the immunological memory of a previous infection was hypothesized to drive formation of suboptimal anti-Ep9 Abs in severe COVID-19 infections. This study identifies a putative primary antigen capable of stimulating production of cross-reactive, anti-Ep9 Abs. Binding assays with patient blood samples directly show cross-reactivity between Abs binding to Ep9 and only one bioinformatics-derived, homologous potential antigen, a sequence derived from the neuraminidase protein of H3N2 Influenza A virus. This cross-reactive binding is highly influenza strain specific and sensitive to even single amino acid changes in epitope sequence. The neuraminidase protein is not present in the influenza vaccine, and the anti-Ep9 Abs likely resulted from the widespread influenza infection in 2014. Therefore, AIM from a previous infection could underlie some cases of COVID-19 disease severity.\nInfections with SARS-COV-2 result in diverse disease outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. The mechanisms underlying different disease outcomes remain largely unexplained. Previously, our laboratory identified a strong association between the presence of an antibody and increased disease severity in a subset of COVID-19 patients. Here, we report that this severity-associated antibody cross-reacts with viral proteins from an influenza A viral strain from 2014. Therefore, we speculate that antibodies generated against previous infections, like the 2014 influenza A, play a significant role in directing some peoplesâ€™ immune responses against SARS-COV-2. Such understanding of the sources and drivers of COVID-19 disease severity can help early identification and pre-emptive treatment.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-06-16', 'authors': ['Sanjana RSen', 'Emily CSanders', 'Alicia MSantos', 'KeertnaBhuvan', 'Derek YTang', 'Aidan AGelston', 'Brian MMiller', 'Joni LRicks-Oddie', 'Gregory AWeiss'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.05.21.445201'}
{'title': 'Function is more reliable than quantity to follow up the humoral response to the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein after natural infection or COVID-19 vaccination.', 'abstract': 'Both the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and emergence of variants of concern have highlighted the need for functional antibody assays to monitor the humoral response over time. Antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are an important component of the neutralizing antibody response. In this work, we report that in a subset of patients-despite a decline in total S-specific antibodies-neutralizing antibody titers remain at a similar level for an average of 98 days in longitudinal sampling of a cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We also report that serum neutralization capacity correlates with IgG titers, wherein IgG1 was the predominant isotype (62.71%), followed by IgG4 (15.25%), IgG3 (13.56%), and IgG2 (8.47%) at the earliest tested timepoint. IgA titers were detectable in just 28.81% of subjects, and only 62.71% of subjects had detectable IgM in the first sample despite confirmation of infection by a molecular diagnostic assay. Our data suggests that 100% of seroconverting patients make detectable neutralizing antibody responses which can be quantified by a surrogate viral neutralization test. Examination of sera from 10 out of the 59 subjects which had received an initial first dose of mRNA-based vaccination revealed that both IgG titers and neutralizing activity of sera were higher after vaccination compared to a cohort of 21 SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. One dose was sufficient for induction of neutralizing antibody, but two doses were necessary to reach 100% surrogate virus neutralization in subjects irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status. Like the pattern seen after natural infection, after the second vaccine dose, the total anti-S antibodies titers declined, however, neutralizing activity remained relatively constant for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. The decline in anti-S antibody titer, however, was significantly less in pre-exposed individuals, highlighting the potential for natural infection to prime a more robust immune response to the vaccine. Furthermore, our data indicates that-compared with mRNA vaccination-natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response in unexposed subjects. However, this difference was significant only when neutralizing antibody titers were compared among the two groups. No differences were observed between naturally infected and vaccinated individuals when total anti-S antibodies and IgG titers were measured. This work is an important contribution to understanding the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely impacted by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, by comparing the dynamics of the immune response after the natural infection vs. the vaccination, these findings suggest that a functional neutralizing antibody tests are more relevant indicators than the presence or absence of binding antibodies. In this context, our results also support standardizing methods of assessing the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 when determining vaccine efficacy and describing the immune correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2.', 'journal': 'medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences', 'date': '2021-06-09', 'authors': ['Carlos ASariol', 'PetraleighPantoja', 'CrisantaSerrano-Collazo', 'TiffanyRosa-Arocho', 'AlbersyArmina', 'LornaCruz', 'E TaylorStone', 'TeresaArana', 'ConsueloCliment', 'GerardoLatoni', 'DianneAtehortua', 'ChristinaPabon-Carrero', 'Amelia KPinto', 'James DBrien', 'Ana MEspino'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.06.02.21257975'}
{'title': 'Impaired Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and CLL Patients.', 'abstract': 'Patients with hematologic malignancies are a high priority for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, yet the benefit they will derive is uncertain. We investigated the humoral response to vaccination in 53 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), or CLL patients. Peripheral blood was obtained 2 weeks after first vaccination and 6 weeks after second vaccination for antibody profiling using the multiplex bead-binding assay. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody levels to the spike specific receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated as a measure of response. Subsequently, antibody-positive serum were assayed for neutralization capacity against authentic SARS-CoV-2. Histology was 68% lymphoma and 32% CLL; groups were: patients receiving anti-CD20-based therapy (45%), monitored with disease (28%), receiving BTK inhibitors (19%), or chemotherapy (all HL) (8%). SARS-CoV-2 specific RBD IgG antibody response was decreased across all NHL and CLL groups: 25%, 73%, and 40%, respectively. Antibody IgG titers were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) for CD20 treated and targeted therapy patients, and (p = 0.003) for monitored patients. In 94% of patients evaluated after first and second vaccination, antibody titers did not significantly boost after second vaccination. Only 13% of CD20 treated and 13% of monitored patients generated neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with ICD50s 135 to 1767, and 445 and > 10240. This data has profound implications given the current guidance relaxing masking restrictions and for timing of vaccinations. Unless immunity is confirmed with laboratory testing, these patients should continue to mask, socially distance, and to avoid close contact with non-vaccinated individuals.\nNon Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who are treated with anti-CD20 antibody therapy, BTK inhibitor therapy, or who are monitored with active disease, have decreased antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and decreased antibody titers compared to healthy controls. Antibody titers do not boost following second vaccination, and very few patients generate neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This data is of particular importance, given the recent guidance from the CDC that vaccinated patients no longer need to be masked indoors as well as outdoors. Patients with NHL or CLL who fall into these categories should not consider their immunity from vaccination to be assured.

Currently, a worldwide effort has been mounted to generate billions of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses to immunize the world's population at record speeds. However, there is still demand for alternative effective vaccines that rapidly confer long-term protection and rely upon cost-effective, easily scaled-up manufacturing. Here, we present a Sindbis alphavirus vector (SV), transiently expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SV.Spike), combined with the OX40 immunostimulatory antibody (αOX40) as a novel, highly effective vaccine approach. We show that SV.Spike plus αOX40 elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and a vigorous T-cell response in mice. Protein binding, immunohistochemical and cellular infection assays all show that vaccinated mice sera inhibits spike functions. Immunophenotyping, RNA Seq transcriptome profiles and metabolic analysis indicate a reprogramming of T-cells in vaccinated mice. Activated T-cells were found to mobilize to lung tissue. Most importantly, SV.Spike plus αOX40 provided robust immune protection against infection with authentic coronavirus in transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2-Tg). Finally, our immunization strategy induced strong effector memory response, potentiating protective immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results show the potential of a new Sindbis virus-based vaccine platform to counteract waning immune response that can be used as a new candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2. Given the strong T-cell responses elicited, our vaccine is likely to be effective against variants that are proving challenging, as well as, serve as a platform to develop a broader spectrum pancoronavirus vaccine.

While vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 based on mRNA and adenoviral-vector technologies have been rapidly developed, additional practical and scalable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed to meet global demand. In this context, protein subunit vaccines formulated with appropriate adjuvants represent a promising approach to address this urgent need. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) but is poorly immunogenic. We therefore compared pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, including those activating STING, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9, alone or formulated with aluminum hydroxide (AH), and benchmarked them to AS01B and AS03-like emulsion-based adjuvants for their potential to enhance RBD immunogenicity in young and aged mice. We found that the AH and CpG adjuvant formulation (AH:CpG) demonstrated the highest enhancement of anti-RBD neutralizing Ab titers in both age groups (∼80-fold over AH), and protected aged mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Notably, AH:CpG-adjuvanted RBD vaccine elicited neutralizing Abs against both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 variant at serum concentrations comparable to those induced by the authorized mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. AH:CpG induced similar cytokine and chemokine gene enrichment patterns in the draining lymph nodes of both young adult and aged mice and synergistically enhanced cytokine and chemokine production in human young adult and elderly mononuclear cells.

{'title': 'High neutralizing potency of swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.', 'abstract': 'Perfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) has demonstrated a potential to improve the pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2, but procurement and standardization of CP are barriers to its wide usage. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed but appear insufficient to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 unless two or three of them are being combined. Therefore, heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin, that have been used for decades to fight against infectious agents might represent a highly efficient alternative to the use of CP or mAbs in COVID-19 by targeting multiple antigen epitopes. However, conventional heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal α1,3-galactose (αGal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the genes coding for the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and α1,3-galactosyl-transferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and α-Gal epitopes. We found that pig IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses, a drawback possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 or to avoiding a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Therefore, we immunized CMAH/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to elicit neutralizing antibodies.

The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer-antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to get insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S-antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S-antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S-antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes, and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S-antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S-antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S-antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-05-21', 'authors': ['YiweiCao', 'Yeol KyoChoi', 'MartinFrank', 'HyeonukWoo', 'Sang-JunPark', 'Min SunYeom', 'ChaokSeok', 'WonpilIm'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.05.10.443519'}
{'title': 'Energy Landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Reveals Extensive Conformational Heterogeneity.', 'abstract': 'Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has produced a number of structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, already prompting biomedical outcomes. However, these reported models and their associated electrostatic potential maps represent an unknown admixture of conformations stemming from the underlying energy landscape of the spike protein. As for any protein, some of the spike\'s conformational motions are expected to be biophysically relevant, but cannot be interpreted only by static models. Using experimental cryo-EM images, we present the energy landscape of the spike protein conformations, and identify molecular rearrangements along the most-likely conformational path in the vicinity of the open (so called 1RBD-up) state. The resulting global and local atomic refinements reveal larger movements than those expected by comparing the reported 1RBD-up and 1RBD-down cryo-EM models. Here we report greater degrees of "openness" in global conformations of the 1RBD-up state, not revealed in the single-model interpretations of the density maps, together with conformations that overlap with the reported models. We discover how the glycan shield contributes to the stability of these conformations along the minimum free-energy pathway. A local analysis of seven key binding pockets reveals that six out them, including those for engaging ACE2, therapeutic mini-proteins, linoleic acid, two different kinds of antibodies, and protein-glycan interaction sites, switch conformations between their known apo- and holo-conformations, even when the global spike conformation is 1RBD-up. This is reminiscent of a conformational pre-equilibrium. We found only one binding pocket, namely antibody AB-C135 to remain closed along the entire minimum free energy path, suggesting an induced fit mechanism for this enzyme.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-05-21', 'authors': ['GhonchehMashayekhi', 'JohnVant', 'AbhishekSingharoy', 'AbbasOurmazd'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.05.11.443708'}

Although some individual mAbs showed reduced or abrogated neutralizing activity against B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 viruses with E484K spike protein mutations in cell culture, low prophylactic doses of mAb combinations protected against infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, 129S2 immunocompetent mice, and hamsters without emergence of resistance.

The majority of current point-of-care antibody tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on lateral flow assays, but these do not offer quantitative information. To address this, we developed a new method of COVID-19 antibody testing employing hemagglutination tested on a dry card, similar to that which is already available for rapid typing of ABO blood groups. A fusion protein linking red blood cells (RBCs) to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was placed on the card. 200 COVID-19 patient and 200 control plasma samples were reconstituted with O-negative RBCs to form whole blood and added to the dried protein, followed by a stirring step and a tilting step, 3-minute incubation, and a second tilting step. The sensitivity for the hemagglutination test, Euroimmun IgG ELISA test and RBD-based CoronaChek lateral flow assay was 87.0%, 86.5%, and 84.5%, respectively, using samples obtained from recovered COVID-19 individuals. Testing pre-pandemic samples, the hemagglutination test had a specificity of 95.5%, compared to 97.3% and 98.9% for the ELISA and CoronaChek, respectively. A distribution of agglutination strengths was observed in COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples, with the highest agglutination score (4) exhibiting significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than weak positives (2) (p<0.0001). Strong agglutinations were observed within 1 minute of testing, and this shorter assay time also increased specificity to 98.5%. In conclusion, we developed a novel rapid, point-of-care RBC agglutination test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that can yield semi-quantitative information on neutralizing antibody titer in patients.

Some recent reports have used immunodominant spike (S) antigenic peptides and anti-CD28 co-stimulation in varying combinations to assess T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These assays may cause T-cell hyperstimulation and could overestimate antiviral immunity in chronically immunosuppressed transplant recipients, who are predisposed to infections and vaccination failures. Here, we evaluate CD154-expressing T-cells induced by unselected S antigenic peptides in 204 subjects-103 COVID-19 patients and 101 healthy unexposed subjects. Subjects included 72 transplanted and 130 non-transplanted subjects. S-reactive CD154+T-cells co-express and can thus substitute for IFNγ (n=3). Assay reproducibility in a variety of conditions was acceptable with coefficient of variation of 2-10.6%.

Some of these new variants, such as B.1.351 and B.1.1.17, manifest higher infectivity and virulence than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, with potential dramatic effects on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on point nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast, insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the spike protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence and other inserts might have contributed to coronavirus pathogenicity as well. Here, we investigate insertions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identify 141 unique inserts of different lengths. We present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing errors. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. We show that inserts in the Spike glycoprotein can affect its antigenic properties and thus have to be monitored.

The nonhuman primate (NHP) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection replicates key features of human infection and may be used to define immune correlates of protection following vaccination. Here, NHP received either no vaccine or doses ranging from 0.3 - 100 μg of mRNA-1273, a mRNA vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P) protein encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle. mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited robust circulating and mucosal antibody responses in a dose-dependent manner. Viral replication was significantly reduced in bronchoalveolar lavages and nasal swabs following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vaccinated animals and was most strongly correlated with levels of anti-S antibody binding and neutralizing activity. Consistent with antibodies being a correlate of protection, passive transfer of vaccine-induced IgG to naïve hamsters was sufficient to mediate protection. Taken together, these data show that mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced humoral immune responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHP.\nmRNA-1273 vaccine-induced antibody responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHP.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-04-29', 'authors': ['Kizzmekia SCorbett', 'Martha CNason', 'BrittaFlach', 'MatthewGagne', "SarahO' Connell", 'Timothy SJohnston', 'Shruti NShah', 'Venkata ViswanadhEdara', 'KatharineFloyd', 'LilinLai', 'CharleneMcDanal', 'Joseph RFrancica', 'BarbaraFlynn', 'KaiWu', 'AngelaChoi', 'MatthewKoch', 'Olubukola MAbiona', 'Anne PWerner', 'Gabriela SAlvarado', 'Shayne FAndrew', 'Mitzi MDonaldson', 'JonathanFintzi', 'Dillon RFlebbe', 'EvanLamb', 'Amy TNoe', 'Saule TNurmukhambetova', 'Samantha JProvost', 'AnthonyCook', 'AlanDodson', 'AndrewFaudree', 'JackGreenhouse', 'SwagataKar', 'LaurentPessaint', 'MacielPorto', 'KatelynSteingrebe', 'DanielValentin', 'SergeZouantcha', 'Kevin WBock', 'MahnazMinai', 'Bianca MNagata', 'Juan IMoliva', 'Reneevan de Wetering', 'SeyhanBoyoglu-Barnum', 'KwanyeeLeung', 'WeiShi', 'Eun SungYang', 'YiZhang', 'John-Paul MTodd', 'LingshuWang', 'HanneAndersen', 'Kathryn EFoulds', 'Darin KEdwards', 'John RMascola', 'Ian NMoore', 'Mark GLewis', 'AndreaCarfi', 'DavidMontefiori', 'Mehul SSuthar', 'AdrianMcDermott', 'Nancy JSullivan', 'MarioRoederer', 'Daniel CDouek', 'Barney SGraham', 'Robert ASeder'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.04.20.440647'}

Safe and effective vaccines are now available, including Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) that showed 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. mRNA-1273 encodes for a prefusion stabilized full length spike (S) protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to concerns of viral escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Several emerging variants have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine induced immunity, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. Here, we present the initial evaluation in mice of two updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccines designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants: (1) monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the S protein found in the B.1.351 lineage and (2) mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. Both vaccines were evaluated as a 2-dose primary series in mice; mRNA-1273.351 was also evaluated as a booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with 2-doses of mRNA-1273. The results demonstrated that a primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273.351 was effective at increasing neutralizing antibody titers against the B.1.351 lineage, while mRNA-1273.211 was most effective at providing broad cross-variant neutralization in mice.

In addition, neutralizing, effector antibody and cellular responses targeted the heterotypic SARS-CoV-1, highlighting the broad immunogenicity of RFN-ALFQ for SARS-like betacoronavirus vaccine development.\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) that reduce the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines is a major threat to pandemic control. We evaluate a SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain ferritin nanoparticle protein vaccine (RFN) in a nonhuman primate challenge model that addresses the need for a next-generation, efficacious vaccine with increased pan-SARS breadth of coverage. RFN, adjuvanted with a liposomal-QS21 formulation (ALFQ), elicits humoral and cellular immune responses exceeding those of current vaccines in terms of breadth and potency and protects against high-dose respiratory tract challenge. Neutralization activity against the B.1.351 VOC within two-fold of wild-type virus and against SARS-CoV-1 indicate exceptional breadth.

A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429) was originally detected in California and is currently spreading throughout the US and 29 additional countries. It is unclear whether antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the prototypic Wuhan-1 isolate-based vaccines will be impacted by the three B.1.427/B.1.429 S mutations: S13I, W152C and L452R. Here, we assessed neutralizing Ab responses following natural infection or mRNA vaccination using pseudoviruses expressing the wildtype or the B.1.427/B.1.429 S protein. Plasma from vaccinated or convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, which were reduced 3-6 fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wildtype pseudoviruses. The RBD L452R mutation reduced or abolished neutralizing activity of 14 out of 35 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including three clinical-stage mAbs. Furthermore, we observed a complete loss of B.1.427/B.1.429 neutralization for a panel of mAbs targeting the N-terminal domain due to a large structural rearrangement of the NTD antigenic supersite involving an S13I-mediated shift of the signal peptide cleavage site.

The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to enrich the Golgi-resident fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on soluble and virion S trimers, is predominantly modified in the Golgi by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-04-07', 'authors': ['ShijianZhang', 'Eden PGo', 'HaitaoDing', 'SaumyaAnang', 'John CKappes', 'HeatherDesaire', 'JosephSodroski'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.04.01.438120'}
{'title': 'Hydrogel-based slow release of a receptor-binding domain subunit vaccine elicits neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2.', 'abstract': 'The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, we found that clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum were unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here we show that sustained delivery of an RBD/CpG/Alum subunit vaccine in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel depot increased total anti-RBD antibody titers and elicited potent anti-spike titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did not. Together, these results suggest that slow delivery of RBD subunit vaccines with PNP hydrogels can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of RBD and induce neutralizing humoral immunity.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-04-07', 'authors': ['Emily CGale', 'Abigail EPowell', 'Gillie ARoth', 'Emily LMeany', 'JerryYan', 'Ben SOu', 'Abigail KGrosskopf', 'JuliaAdamska', 'Vittoria C T MPicece', 'Andrea IDâ Aquino', 'BaliPulendran', 'Peter SKim', 'Eric AAppel'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.03.31.437792'}

We used a highly specific serological assay utilizing the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in remnant blood samples collected by the University of North Carolina Health system.

We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA developed in the US, using two-antigen SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain. To optimize test performance, we compared single and two-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs for Malian control samples (positive and negative).

To determine the effects of somatic mutation on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, we analyzed six independent antibody lineages. As well as increased neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed pathways for acquisition of resistance and, in some cases, restricted the range of neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation apparently imposed a requirement for multiple spike mutations to enable escape. For certain antibody lineages, maturation enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD.

{'title': 'Acquisition of the L452R mutation in the ACE2-binding interface of Spike protein triggers recent massive expansion of SARS-Cov-2 variants.', 'abstract': 'The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently. The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies.

Systematic structural comparison of neutralizing Abs and Nbs provides critical insights into how Nbs uniquely target the spike to achieve high-affinity and broadly neutralizing activity against the evolving virus.

{'title': 'Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are detectable in saliva.', 'abstract': 'Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within ∼1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1-2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion.

We show that a clinical stage multivalent SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP) protects mice from SARS-CoV-2-induced disease after a single shot, indicating that the vaccine could allow dose-sparing. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP elicits high antibody titers in two non-human primate (NHP) models against multiple distinct RBD antigenic sites known to be recognized by neutralizing antibodies. We benchmarked NHP serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NP against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen using a panel of single-residue spike mutants detected in clinical isolates as well as the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are resilient to most RBD mutations tested, but the E484K substitution has similar negative consequences for neutralization, and exhibit modest but comparable neutralization breadth against distantly related sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate that mosaic and cocktail sarbecovirus RBD-NPs elicit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, including against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, and protect mice against severe SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of the SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine.

{'title': 'Longitudinal Analysis Reveals Distinct Antibody and Memory B Cell Responses in SARS-CoV2 Naïve and Recovered Individuals Following mRNA Vaccination.', 'abstract': 'Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have been authorized for emergency use and are currently being administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a prior SARS-CoV2 infection compared to SARS-CoV2 naïve subjects. Moreover, how mRNA vaccines impact the development of antibodies as well as memory B cells in COVID-19 experienced versus COVID-19 naïve subjects remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated antibody responses and antigen-specific memory B cell responses over time in 33 SARS-CoV2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects. mRNA vaccination induced significant antibody and memory B cell responses against full-length SARS-CoV2 spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals benefitted from both doses of mRNA vaccine with additional increases in antibodies and memory B cells following booster immunization. In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a significant immune response after the first dose with no increase in circulating antibodies or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. Moreover, the magnitude of the memory B cell response induced by vaccination was lower in older individuals, revealing an age-dependence to mRNA vaccine-induced B cell memory. Side effects also tended to associate with post-boost antibody levels, but not with post-boost memory B cells, suggesting that side effect severity may be a surrogate of short-term antibody responses. The frequency of pre-vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals strongly correlated with post-vaccine antibody levels, supporting a key role for memory B cells in humoral recall responses to SARS-CoV2. This observation may have relevance for future booster vaccines and for responses to viral variants that partially escape pre-existing antibodies and require new humoral responses to be generated from memory B cells. Finally, post-boost antibody levels were not correlated with post-boost memory responses in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals, indicating that short-term antibody levels and memory B cells are complementary immunological endpoints that should be examined in tandem when evaluating vaccine response. Together, our data provide evidence of both serological response and immunological memory following mRNA vaccination that is distinct based on prior SARS-CoV2 exposure.

{'title': 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody magnitude and detectability are driven by disease severity, timing, and assay.', 'abstract': 'Serosurveillance studies are critical for estimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immunity, but interpretation of results is currently limited by poorly defined variability in the performance of antibody assays to detect seroreactivity over time in individuals with different clinical presentations. We measured longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in plasma samples from a diverse cohort of 128 individuals over 160 days using 14 binding and neutralization assays. For all assays, we found a consistent and strong effect of disease severity on antibody magnitude, with fever, cough, hospitalization, and oxygen requirement explaining much of this variation. We found that binding assays measuring responses to spike protein had consistently higher correlation with neutralization than those measuring responses to nucleocapsid, regardless of assay format and sample timing. However, assays varied substantially with respect to sensitivity during early convalescence and in time to seroreversion. Variations in sensitivity and durability were particularly dramatic for individuals with mild infection, who had consistently lower antibody titers and represent the majority of the infected population, with sensitivities often differing substantially from reported test characteristics (e.g., amongst commercial assays, sensitivity at 6 months ranged from 33% for ARCHITECT IgG to 98% for VITROS Total Ig). Thus, the ability to detect previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 is highly dependent on the severity of the initial infection, timing relative to infection, and the assay used.

Whereas passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable option, selection of optimal units for therapy and lack of clear therapeutic benefit from transfusion remain as barriers to the use of CCP.\nTo identify plasma that is expected to benefit recipients, we measured anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody levels using clinically available serological assays and correlated with the neutralizing activity of CCP from donors. Neutralizing titer of plasma samples was measured by assaying infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped retrovirus particles in the presence of dilutions of plasma samples. We also used this assay to identify evidence of passive transfusion of neutralizing activity in CCP recipients.\nViral neutralization and anti-spike protein antibodies in 109 samples from 87 plasma donors were highly varied but modestly correlated with each other. Recipients who died of COVID-19 were found to have been transfused with units with lower anti-spike antibody levels and neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of neutralization activity was documented in 62% of antibody naive plasma recipients.\nSince viral neutralization is the goal of CCP transfusion, our observations not only support the use of anti-spike SARS-CoV2 serology tests to identify beneficial CCP units, but also support the therapeutic value of convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-spike antibodies.', 'journal': 'medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences', 'date': '2021-03-11', 'authors': ['Sanath KumarJanaka', 'WilliamHartman', 'HuihuiMou', 'MichaelFarzan', 'Susan LStramer', 'ErinGoodhue', 'JohnWeiss', 'DavidEvans', 'Joseph PConnor'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.02.25.21252463'}
{'title': 'Multimeric nanobodies from camelid engineered mice and llamas potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants.', 'abstract': 'Since the start of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide. Multiple vaccines have been deployed to date, but the continual evolution of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) has recently challenged their efficacy. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 variants originating in the U.K. (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and New York (B.1.526) have reduced neutralization activity from convalescent sera and compromised the efficacy of antibody cocktails that received emergency use authorization. Whereas vaccines can be updated periodically to account for emerging variants, complementary strategies are urgently needed to avert viral escape. One potential alternative is the use of camelid VHHs (also known as nanobodies), which due to their small size can recognize protein crevices that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and "nanomice" we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and camels. Through binding assays and cryo-electron microscopy, we identified two sets of highly neutralizing nanobodies. The first group expresses VHHs that circumvent RBD antigenic drift by recognizing a region outside the ACE2-binding site that is conserved in coronaviruses but is not typically targeted by monoclonal antibodies. The second group is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and fails to neutralize pseudoviruses carrying the E484K or N501Y substitutions. Notably however, they do neutralize the RBD variants when expressed as homotrimers, rivaling the most potent antibodies produced to date against SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2 binding domain, and recognition of conserved epitopes largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, while new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-03-11', 'authors': ['JianliangXu', 'KaiXu', 'SeolkyoungJung', 'AndreaConte', 'JennaLieberman', 'FraukeMuecksch', 'Julio CesarCetrulo Lorenzi', 'SoljiPark', 'ZijunWang', 'LinoTessarollo', 'TatsianaBylund', 'Gwo-YuChuang', 'Adam SOlia', 'TylerStephens', 'I-TingTeng', 'YaroslavTsybovsky', 'TongqingZhou', 'TheodoraHatziioannou', 'Paul DBieniasz', 'Michel CNussenzweig', 'Peter DKwong', 'RafaelCasellas'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.03.04.433768'}

We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged \nMutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19.

The introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines has reduced the incidence of rotavirus disease in many countries. To explore the possibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.\nAmong the vaccines administered to children in the US and many other countries are those targeting rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis.

Non-synonymous substitutions affecting S are not uncommon and have become fixed in a number of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. A subset of such mutations enable escape from neutralizing antibodies or are thought to enhance transmission through mechanisms such as increased affinity for the cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Independent genomic surveillance programs based in New Mexico and Louisiana contemporaneously detected the rapid rise of numerous clade 20G (lineage B.1.2) infections carrying a Q677P substitution in S. The variant was first detected in the US on October 23, yet between 01 Dec 2020 and 19 Jan 2021 it rose to represent 27.8% and 11.3% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from Louisiana and New Mexico, respectively. Q677P cases have been detected predominantly in the south central and southwest United States; as of 03 Feb 2021, GISAID data show 499 viral sequences of this variant from the USA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the independent evolution and spread of at least six distinct Q677H sub-lineages, with first collection dates ranging from mid-August to late November 2020. Four 677H clades from clade 20G (B.1.2), 20A (B.1.234), and 20B (B.1.1.220, and B.1.1.222) each contain roughly 100 or fewer sequenced cases, while a distinct pair of clade 20G clusters are represented by 754 and 298 cases, respectively. Although sampling bias and founder effects may have contributed to the rise of S:677 polymorphic variants, the proximity of this position to the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary are consistent with its potential functional relevance during cell entry, suggesting parallel evolution of a trait that may confer an advantage in spread or transmission.

With the rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such assays must be able to distinguish vaccine from natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and related human coronaviruses. Here, we developed and implemented multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay strategies for COVD-19 antibody studies that incorporates spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV), enabling high throughout measurement of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We varied SARS-CoV-2 antigen compositions within the multiplex assay, allowing direct comparisons of the effects of spike protein, receptor-binding domain protein (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) based SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. Multiplex immunoassay performance characteristics are antigen-dependent, and sensitivities and specificities range 92-99% and 94-100%, respectively, for human subject samples collected as early as 7-10 days from symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD had a strong correlative relationship for the detection of IgG. Correlation between detectable IgG reactive with spike and NP also had strong relationship, however, several PCR-positive and spike IgG-positive serum samples were NP IgG-negative.

{'title': 'Adjuvanting a subunit SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine to induce protective immunity in non-human primates.', 'abstract': 'The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03 immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination. AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro.

In this study, we used a live virus neutralization assay to compare the neutralization potency of sera from infected and vaccinated individuals against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. We found that both infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies were effective at neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant.

Using convalescent sera collected from 101 COVID-19 recovered individuals 21-212 days after symptom onset with forty-eight additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies. We also evaluated associations between individual demographic and clinical parameters with functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19.

We also show that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent neutralizing antibodies are higher in individuals with cardio-metabolic comorbidities.\nIn this study we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with RBD Ig binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses.

We also show for the first time, that higher convalescent antibody titers in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade.

A variant of SARS-COV-2 (20I/501Y.V1) recently discovered in the United Kingdom has a single mutation from N501 to Y501 within the receptor binding domain (Y501-RBD), of the Spike protein of the virus. This variant is much more contagious than the original version (N501-RBD). We found that this mutated version of RBD binds to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) a ~10 times more tightly than the native version (N501-RBD). Modeling analysis showed that the N501Y mutation would allow a potential aromatic ring-ring interaction and an additional hydrogen bond between the RBD and ACE2. However, sera from individuals immunized with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still efficiently block the binding of Y501-RBD to ACE2 though with a slight compromised manner by comparison with their ability to inhibit binding to ACE2 of N501-RBD. This may raise the concern whether therapeutic anti-RBD antibodies used to treat COVID-19 patients are still efficacious.

Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ≈45% showed neutralizing activity of which ≈20% were NTD-specific. None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.

Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, overall percent agreement (PA), and Cohen kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4-92.1% and NPA: 69.2-91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9-100% and NPA: 50.0-84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6-96.6% and NPA: 50.0-100%.

It is of great concern that newly emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can escape antibody-mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the spike protein. The glutamate (E) to Lysine (K) substitution at position 484 (E484K) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed in vitro microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold) compared to USA-WA1/2020. For some of the convalescent donor sera with low or moderate IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the drop in neutralization efficiency resulted in neutralization ID50 values similar to negative control samples, with low or even absence of neutralization of the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. However, human sera with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite.

{'title': 'Longitudinal analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals up to 8 months post-symptom onset.', 'abstract': 'Functional and lasting immune responses to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are currently under intense investigation as antibody titers in plasma have been shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance.

We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period.

To define the genetic and structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies COV2-2196 and COV2-21301, which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. COV2-2196 forms an 'aromatic cage' at the heavy/light chain interface using germline-encoded residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals1-4. The structure of COV2-2130 reveals that an unusually long LCDR1 and HCDR3 make interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of COV2-2196. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the critical residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern for possible viral escape. Nonetheless, both COV2-2196 and COV2130 showed strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain with recent variations of concern including E484K, N501Y, and D614G substitutions.

They are determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids and may be reflected in the protein three-dimensional structure. Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes is a critical step for understanding protein function and disease mechanism as well as enabling drug discovery. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2's spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain - both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction. We observed concordance of the DMS data and our neural network predictions with an independent study on intermolecular interactions from molecular dynamics (multiple 500 ns or 1 μs all-atom) simulations of the spike protein-ACE2 interface, with critical implications for the use of deep learning to dissect molecular mechanisms.

One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected.

Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Two monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization, and more are in the pipeline. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however. Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK and B.1.351 in South Africa is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple potent mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation. Moreover, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (~11-33 fold) and vaccinee sera (~6.5-8.6 fold).

With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only.

The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated ~94% efficacy in a Phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus.

Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants, though the current therapeutic options remain limited and expensive. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its D614G mutant.

However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

As the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future combination therapy.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2021-01-15', 'authors': ['Zhen-LuLi', 'MatthiasBuck'], 'doi': '10.1101/2021.01.06.425627'}

Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs.

The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-S titer but that suffer from low neutralizing activity.

{'title': 'Engineered receptor binding domain immunogens elicit pan-sarbecovirus neutralizing antibodies outside the receptor binding motif.', 'abstract': 'Effective countermeasures are needed against emerging coronaviruses of pandemic potential, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Designing immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to conserved viral epitopes on the major surface glycoprotein, spike, such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) is one potential approach. Here, we report the generation of homotrimeric RBD immunogens from different sarbecoviruses using a stabilized, immune-silent trimerization tag. In mice, we find that a cocktail of these homotrimeric sarbecovirus RBDs elicits antibodies to conserved viral epitopes outside of the ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM). Importantly, these responses neutralize all sarbecovirus components even in context of prior SARS-CoV-2 imprinting. We further show that a substantial fraction of the neutralizing antibodies elicited after vaccination in humans also engages non-RBM epitopes on the RBD. Collectively, our results suggest a strategy for eliciting broadly neutralizing responses leading to a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.\nImmunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the human population will be widespread due to natural infection and vaccination. However, another novel coronavirus will likely emerge in the future and may cause a subsequent pandemic. Humoral responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination provide limited protection against even closely related coronaviruses. We show immunization with a cocktail of trimeric coronavirus receptor binding domains induces a neutralizing antibody response that is broadened to related coronaviruses with pandemic potential. Importantly, this broadening occurs in context of an initial imprinted SARS-CoV-2 spike immunization showing that preexisting immunity can be expanded to recognize other related coronaviruses.

Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted anti-viral antibody response is critical for diagnosis, differentiation of severe disease, and characterization of long-term immunity. Initial observations suggest that severe disease is associated with higher antibody levels and greater B cell/plasmablast responses. A multi-antigen immunoassay to define the complex serological landscape and clinical associations is essential.\nWe developed a multiplex immunoassay and evaluated serum/plasma from adults with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during acute illness (N=52) and convalescence (N=69); and pre-pandemic (N=106) and post-pandemic (N=137) healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N), Spike domain 1 (S1), receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain (S1-NTD).\nTo diagnose infection, the combined [IgA+IgG+IgM] or IgG for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded AUC values -0.90 by ROC curves. From days 6-30 post-symptom onset, the levels of antigen-specific IgG, IgA or [IgA+IgG+IgM] were higher in patients with severe/critical compared to mild/moderate infections. Consistent with excessive concentrations of antibodies, a strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients. Notably, mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared to severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 months.\nThis SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity and kinetics of the antibody response against multiple viral antigens. The IgG and combined-isotype SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay is highly diagnostic of acute and convalescent disease and may prognosticate severity early in illness.\nIn contrast to patients with moderate infections, those with severe COVID-19 develop prominent, early antibody responses to S1 and N proteins.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-12-11', 'authors': ['Natalie SHaddad', 'Doan CNguyen', 'Merin EKuruvilla', 'AndreaMorrison-Porter', 'FablihaAnam', 'Kevin SCashman', 'Richard PRamonell', 'ShuyaKyu', 'Ankur SinghSaini', 'MonicaCabrera-Mora', 'AndrewDerrico', 'DavidAlter', 'John DRoback', 'MichaelHorwath', "James BO'Keefe", 'Henry MWu', 'An-KwokIan Wong', 'Alexandra WDretler', 'RiaGripaldo', 'Andrea NLane', 'HaoWu', 'SaeyunLee', 'MindyHernandez', 'VanessaEngineer', 'JohnVarghese', 'SangLe', 'IñakiSanz', 'John LDaiss', 'FEun-Hyung Lee'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.12.04.410589'}

We used multi-parameter flow cytometry and systems serology to comprehensively profile the functions of T cells and antibodies targeting spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins in a convalescent cohort of COVID-19 subjects who were either hospitalized (n=20) or not hospitalized (n=40). To avoid confounding, subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, and date of symptom onset. Surprisingly, we found that the magnitude and functional breadth of virus-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses were consistently higher among hospitalized subjects, particularly those with medical comorbidities. However, an integrated analysis identified more coordination between polyfunctional CD4 T-cells and antibodies targeting the S1 domain of spike among subjects that were not hospitalized. These data reveal a functionally diverse and coordinated response between T cells and antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 which is reduced in the presence of comorbid illnesses that are known risk factors for severe COVID-19.

Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging SARS-like CoVs.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-11-26', 'authors': ['C GarrettRappazzo', 'Longping VTse', 'Chengzi IKaku', 'DanielWrapp', 'MrunalSakharkar', 'DeliHuang', 'Laura MDeveau', 'Thomas JYockachonis', 'Andrew SHerbert', 'Michael BBattles', "Cecilia MO'Brien", 'Michael EBrown', 'James CGeoghegan', 'JonathanBelk', 'LinghangPeng', 'LinlinYang', 'Trevor DScobey', 'Dennis RBurton', 'DavidNemazee', 'John MDye', 'James EVoss', 'Bronwyn MGunn', 'Jason SMcLellan', 'Ralph SBaric', 'Lisa EGralinski', 'Laura MWalker'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.11.17.385500'}

Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that ∼23% of these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins.

Potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies derived from closely related antibody heavy chain genes (IGHV3-53 or 3-66) have been isolated from multiple COVID-19 convalescent individuals. These usually contain minimal somatic mutations and bind the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) to interfere with attachment to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used antigen-specific single B cell sorting to isolate S-reactive monoclonal antibodies from the blood of a COVID-19 convalescent individual. The seven most potent neutralizing antibodies were somatic variants of the same IGHV3-53-derived antibody and bind the RBD with varying affinity. We report X-ray crystal structures of four Fab variants bound to the RBD and use the structures to explain the basis for changes in RBD affinity. We show that a germline revertant antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizes virus, and that gains in affinity for the RBD do not necessarily correlate with increased neutralization potency, suggesting that somatic mutation is not required to exert robust antiviral effect.

However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies.

Infection is associated with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect against infection in animal models.

We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by five-fold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months after coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) onset, using immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers.

We performed multi-dimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD)-specific MBC in cohorts of ambulatory COVID-19 patients with mild disease, and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease, at a median of 54 (39-104) days after onset of symptoms.

Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge.

We analyzed more than 300,000 high quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) associated region of the nucleocapsid protein are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals four distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March-July, during a period of stasis in terms of inter-regional diversity.

The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts - are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region.

To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield.

Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular Spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domain-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer, and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.\nAs the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has been the subject of extensive structural and antibody design efforts in aims to curtail COVID-19 spread. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the homodimer ACE2 full-length structure to study the dynamics of this protein in the context of the cellular membrane. The simulations evidence exceptional plasticity in the protein structure due to flexible hinge motions in the head-transmembrane domain linker region and helix mobility in the membrane, resulting in a varied ensemble of conformations distinct from the experimental structures. Our findings suggest a dynamical contribution of ACE2 to the spike glycoprotein shedding required for infection, and contribute to the question of stoichiometry of the Spike-ACE2 complex.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-10-01', 'authors': ['E PBarros', 'LCasalino', 'ZGaieb', 'A CDommer', 'YWang', 'LFallon', 'LRaguette', 'KBelfon', 'CSimmerling', 'R EAmaro'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.09.16.300459'}

Here, we identified functionally distinct SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cell subsets by profiling the repertoire of convalescent COVID-19 patients using a high-throughput B cell sorting and sequencing platform. Utilizing barcoded SARS-CoV-2 antigen baits, we isolated thousands of B cells that segregated into discrete functional subsets specific for the spike, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and open reading frame (ORF) proteins 7a and 8. Spike-specific B cells were enriched in canonical MBC clusters, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from these cells were potently neutralizing. By contrast, B cells specific to ORF8 and NP were enriched in naïve and innate-like clusters, and mAbs against these targets were exclusively non-neutralizing. Finally, we identified that B cell specificity, subset distribution, and affinity maturation were impacted by clinical features such as age, sex, and symptom duration.

The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes.

Structures of soluble ectodomains and native virus particles have revealed distinct conformations of S, including a closed trimer with all RBD oriented downward, trimers with one or two RBDs up, and hACE2-stabilized conformations with up to three RBD oriented up. Real-time information that connects these structures, however, has been lacking. Here we apply single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate, with trypsin partially activating S.

We found that relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated authentic virus-neutralizing titers and antibody levels against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region of spike protein. Unlike disease severity, age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2-3 months post-onset, whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However, 18% (13/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing, but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples, also displayed potent reactivity to S2. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays markedly improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the viral antigen.

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment.

These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2.

There is an incomplete understanding of the host humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during acute infection. Host factors such as age and sex as well the kinetics and functionality of antibody responses are important factors to consider as vaccine development proceeds. The receptor-binding domain of the CoV spike (RBD-S) protein is important in host cell recognition and infection and antibodies targeting this domain are often neutralizing. In a cross-sectional study of anti-RBD-S antibodies in COVID-19 patients we found equivalent levels in male and female patients and no age-related deficiencies even out to 93 years of age. The anti-RBD-S response was evident as little as 6 days after onset of symptoms and for at least 5 weeks after symptom onset. Anti-RBD-S IgG, IgM, and IgA responses were simultaneously induced within 10 days after onset, but isotype-specific kinetics differed such that anti-RBD-S IgG was most sustained over a 5-week period. The kinetics and magnitude of neutralizing antibody formation strongly correlated with that seen for anti-RBD-S antibodies.

The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spike closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor.

Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations.

We combined this information with bioinformatic analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions.

An anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the level of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, yet there is no consensus as to which assay should be used for such measurements. Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2. We also developed a focus reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety level 3. We compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, as well as ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally high degree of concordance. The two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies, immune γ-globulin or plasma preparations, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virion's surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors.

Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in 'up' state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element.

Multiple linear regression and predictive models were utilized to assess the correlations between antibody responses with demographic and clinical characteristics. IgG titers were greater than either IgM or IgA for S1, full length S, and S-RBD in the overall population. Of the 126 plasma samples, 101 (80%) had detectable neutralizing titers.

{'title': 'SARS-CoV-2 growth, furin-cleavage-site adaptation and neutralization using serum from acutely infected, hospitalized COVID-19 patients.', 'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged at the end of 2019 and by mid-June 2020, the virus has spread to at least 215 countries, caused more than 8,000,000 confirmed infections and over 450,000 deaths, and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. Like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1: P4 and Munich: P1) were cultured twice in Vero-E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1: P6 and minor variants in the Munich: P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titers in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal. These studies illustrate the need to characterize virus stocks meticulously prior to performing either ', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-07-02', 'authors': ['William BKlimstra', 'Natasha LTilston-Lunel', 'ShamNambulli', 'JamesBoslett', 'Cynthia MMcMillen', 'TheronGilliland', 'Matthew DDunn', 'ChengqunSun', 'Sarah EWheeler', 'AlanWells', 'Amy LHartman', 'Anita KMcElroy', 'Douglas SReed', 'Linda JRennick', 'W PaulDuprex'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.06.19.154930'}

Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop and as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus attract much attention in the past few months. This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV are evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes.

While Remdesivir has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, convalescent plasma (CP) with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from recovered donors remains a promising and widely accessible method to mitigate severe disease symptoms. Here, we describe the development and validation of a cell-free neutralization PCR assay using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 and human ACE2 receptor-DNA conjugates. By comparing with samples collected prior to the outbreak, we confirmed that NAbs were specifically detected in COVID-19 cases. Using our unique assay, the NAb signals are detectable as early as 10 days after onset of symptoms and continue to rise, plateauing after 18 days. Notably, we showed that the use of licensed pathogen reduction technology to inactivate potentially contaminating infectious pathogens in CP did not alter NAb signals, paving a path to safely administer effective CP therapies. The described neutralization PCR assay can serve as a qualification tool to easily identify suitable CP donors of a potentially lifesaving therapy. In addition, this assay tool is readily deployable in standard laboratories with biosafety level 2 capability, and can yield results within 2-3 hr.

Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates the host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans, and the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike\'s receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift towards the "down" state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be exploited by therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine.

There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (70 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate the performance of the RBD as an antigen for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) to antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a robust correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, strongly support the use of RBD-based antibody assays for population-level surveillance and as a correlate of neutralizing antibody levels in people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections.', 'journal': 'medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences', 'date': '2020-06-09', 'authors': ['LakshmananePremkumar', 'BrunoSegovia-Chumbez', 'RameshJadi', 'David RMartinez', 'RajendraRaut', 'AlenaMarkmann', 'CalebCornaby', 'LutherBartelt', 'SusanWeiss', 'YaraPark', 'Caitlin EEdwards', 'EricWeimer', 'Erin MScherer', 'NadineRoupael', 'SriEdupuganti', 'DanielaWeiskopf', 'Longping VTse', 'Yixuan JHou', 'DavidMargolis', 'AlessandroSette', 'Matthew HCollins', 'JohnSchmitz', 'Ralph SBaric', 'Aravinda Mde Silva'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.05.06.20093377'}

Precise knowledge of population immunity could allow government bodies to make informed decisions about how and when to relax stay-at-home directives and to reopen the economy. We hypothesized that salivary antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for widespread monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the population. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology and tested 167 saliva and 324 serum samples, including 134 and 118 negative saliva and serum samples, respectively, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 33 saliva and 206 serum samples from participants with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated the correlation of results obtained in saliva vs. serum and determined the sensitivity and specificity for each diagnostic media, stratified by antibody isotype, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on COVID-19 case designation for all specimens. Matched serum and saliva SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific IgG responses were significantly correlated. Within the 10-plex SARS-CoV-2 panel, the salivary anti-nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (100% sensitivity at ≥10 days post-SARS-CoV-2 symptom onset). The salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response resulted in 100% specificity. Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with RT-PCR, the temporal kinetics of IgG, IgA, and IgM in saliva were consistent with those observed in serum. SARS-CoV-2 appears to trigger a humoral immune response resulting in the almost simultaneous rise of IgG, IgM and IgA levels both in serum and in saliva, mirroring responses consistent with the stimulation of existing, cross-reactive B cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in saliva can play a critically important role in large-scale 'sero'-surveillance to address key public health priorities and guide policy and decision-making for COVID-19.", 'journal': 'medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences', 'date': '2020-06-09', 'authors': ['Pranay RRandad', 'NoraPisanic', 'KateKruczynski', 'Yukari CManabe', 'DavidThomas', 'AndrewPekosz', 'Sabra LKlein', 'Michael JBetenbaugh', 'William AClarke', 'OliverLaeyendecker', 'Patrizio PCaturegli', 'H BenjaminLarman', 'BarbaraDetrick', 'Jessica KFairley', 'Amy CSherman', 'NadineRouphael', 'SrilathaEdupuganti', 'Douglas AGranger', 'Steve WGranger', 'MatthewCollins', 'Christopher DHeaney'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.05.24.20112300'}

Convalescent serum is being used for treatment and for isolation of patient-derived antibodies. However, currently there is not a simple means to estimate serum bulk neutralizing capability. Here we present an efficient competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individual's seropositivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and estimate the neutralizing capacity of anti-Spike antibodies to block interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this ELISA-based assay, we present natively-folded viral Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then supplemented with soluble ACE2-Fc to compete for RBD-binding serum antibodies, and antibody binding quantified. Comparison of signal from untreated serum and ACE2-Fc-treated serum reveals the presence of antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, as evidenced by loss of signal with ACE2-Fc treatment. In our test cohort of nine convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, we found all patients had developed anti-RBD antibodies targeting the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement.

Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronavirus\'s surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 Å. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the "closed" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in "open" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-06-09', 'authors': ['M GordonJoyce', 'Rajeshwer SSankhala', 'Wei-HungChen', 'MisookChoe', 'HongjunBai', 'AgnesHajduczki', 'LianyingYan', 'Spencer LSterling', 'Caroline EPeterson', 'Ethan CGreen', 'ClaytonSmith', 'Nataliade Val', 'MihretAmare', 'PaulScott', 'Eric DLaing', 'Christopher CBroder', 'MorganeRolland', 'Nelson LMichael', 'KayvonModjarrad'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.03.15.992883'}
{'title': 'Cryo-EM Structure of the 2019-nCoV Spike in the Prefusion Conformation.', 'abstract': 'The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCov) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.', 'journal': 'bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology', 'date': '2020-06-09', 'authors': ['DanielWrapp', 'NianshuangWang', 'Kizzmekia SCorbett', 'Jory AGoldsmith', 'Ching-LinHsieh', 'OlubukolaAbiona', 'Barney SGraham', 'Jason SMcLellan'], 'doi': '10.1101/2020.02.11.944462'}
