S.', 'abstract': 'Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host. Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues replication of HKU5-CoV, a second MERS-like group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate emergence potential of CoVs and offer a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains.\\n\\nImportanceOverall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.', 'date': '2019-09-16', 'journal': ''}

Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.', 'date': '2020-01-28', 'journal': ''}

While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.

We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry.

Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.\n\nSignificance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes).

We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses.

Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo.

The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.

We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the "closed" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in "open" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSHigh resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD).\n\nRecognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SARS-CoV antibodies.\n\nStructure of the SARS-COV-2 RBD in complex with antibody CR3022.\n\nIdentification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.', 'date': '2020-03-17', 'journal': ''}

We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.

Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal/mol ({+/-} 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs.

COVID-19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis. Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level. In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein. Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the constructs were checked using pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of preventive measures to combat COVID-19 infections might be aided the present study.

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a "sandwich" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity.

Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex. These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar/charged residues appear at the interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV. Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even far from the binding interface.

Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being actively developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients were strongly correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.

Z.; Ponnusamy, K.; Rai, E.', 'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.', 'date': '2020-04-24', 'journal': ''}

Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance.\n\nImportanceCOVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail.

There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess the prevalence of infection, as well as ascertain individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which may lack scalability to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests in the coming year. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that just depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum/plasma or whole blood and a short five-minute assay time. A novel fusion protein was designed that binds red blood cells (RBC) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against the H antigen and displays the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Upon mixing of the fusion protein, RBD-scFv with recovered COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs, we observed agglutination of RBCs, indicating the patient developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Given that the test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed with only the protein reagent required at projected manufacturing cost at U.S. cents per test.

In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes. Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself.

Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity.\n\nOBJECTIVES/METHODSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1500) with positive or negative Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\nRESULTSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay proved highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or [&ge;]15 days from diagnosis respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was <5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values in settings with different % disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS. The automated LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests/hour.

DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use.', 'date': '2020-05-20', 'journal': ''}

VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2.

Two important components of viral spread are how frequently variants arise within individuals, and how likely they are to be transmitted. Here, we characterise the within-host diversity of SARS-CoV-2, and the extent to which genetic diversity is transmitted, by quantifying variant frequencies in 1390 clinical samples from the UK, many from individuals in known epidemiological clusters. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by low levels of within-host diversity across the entire viral genome, with evidence of strong evolutionary constraint in Spike, a key target of vaccines and antibody-based therapies. Although within-host variants can be observed in multiple individuals in the same phylogenetic or epidemiological cluster, highly infectious individuals with high viral load carry only a limited repertoire of viral diversity. Most viral variants are either lost, or occasionally fixed, at the point of transmission, consistent with a narrow transmission bottleneck. These results suggest potential vaccine-escape mutations are likely to be rare in infectious individuals. Nonetheless, we identified Spike variants present in multiple individuals that may affect receptor binding or neutralisation by antibodies. Since the fitness advantage of escape mutations in highly-vaccinated populations is likely to be substantial, resulting in rapid spread if and when they do emerge, these findings underline the need for continued vigilance and monitoring.', 'date': '2020-05-28', 'journal': ''}

Here, we analyzed antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and antibody responses in twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19, and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific ASCs in all twenty COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot assay. Out of the 20 patients, 16 had developed SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by the time of inclusion in the study. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibody levels positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels may reflect the titers of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of infection. Lastly, we showed that interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were higher in serum of patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting the recent observations that IL-6 and CRP could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.

The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection, but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.', 'date': '2020-06-01', 'journal': ''}

The virus enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations and that Ty1 sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale.

D.; Suarez, R.; Salcedo, B.; LePique, M.; Graham, M.; Ricana, C.; Robinson, C.; Ritter, D. G.', 'abstract': 'The SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein is solely responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating fusion between the viral and host membranes. The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, MLV, and VSV particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Spike. Infection of 293FT target cells was only possible if the cells were engineered to stably express the human ACE-2 receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5-10 fold. Substitution of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modification of a single amino acid in the furin cleavage site of Spike (R682Q) enhanced infectious particle production another 10-fold. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped particles reached almost 106 infectious particles/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike was successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from COVID-19 patients, but not plasma from uninfected individuals.\n\nImportanceWhen working with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high titer SARS-COV2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.', 'date': '2020-06-03', 'journal': ''}

Initial data suggest that the virus has low mutation rates, but its large genome could facilitate recombination, insertions, and deletions, as has been described in other coronaviruses. Here, we deep-sequenced the complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene from 18 patients (10 with mild and 8 with severe COVID-19), and found that the virus accumulates deletions upstream and very close to the S1/S2 cleavage site, generating a frameshift with appearance of a stop codon. These deletions were found in a small percentage of the viral quasispecies (2.2%) in samples from all the mild and only half the severe COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that the virus may generate free S1 protein released to the circulation. We propose that natural selection has favored a "Dont burn down the house" strategy, in which free S1 protein may compete with viral particles for the ACE2 receptor, thus reducing the severity of the infection and tissue damage without losing transmission capability.', 'date': '2020-06-03', 'journal': ''}

The Spike (S) protein of the virus forms projections on the virion surface responsible for host cell attachment and penetration. This viral glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor in infected cells and, to be active, must be cleaved to two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2(3,4). For SARS-CoV-2 the cleavage is catalysed by furin, a host cell protease, which cleaves the S protein precursor at a specific sequence motif that generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (RRAR) C-terminal sequence on S1. This sequence motif conforms to the C-end rule (CendR), which means that the C-terminal sequence may allow the protein to associate with cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors5. Here we demonstrate using immunoprecipitation, site-specific mutagenesis, structural modelling, and antibody blockade that, in addition to engaging the known receptor ACE2, S1 can bind to NRP1 through the canonical CendR mechanism. This interaction enhances infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provides a therapeutic target for COVID-19.', 'date': '2020-06-05', 'journal': ''}

Experience with SARS and MERS coronaviruses has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human naive universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2 in the scFv-Fc format, assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1.

F.; Xiao, S.; Peng, G.', 'abstract': 'Coronaviruses that infect humans belong to the Alpha-coronavirus (including HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) genera. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the "standing" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the "lying" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.\n\nImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.', 'date': '2020-06-09', 'journal': ''}

Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site.

Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates the host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans, and the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spikes receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift towards the "down" state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be exploited by therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the RBD that could be harnessed for vaccine development.', 'date': '2020-06-11', 'journal': ''}

Here in this work, we performed an in-silico analysis on the protein-protein interactions between the receptor-binding (RBD) domain of viral SPIKE protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to highlight the key alteration that happened from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed and compared the molecular differences between these two viruses by using various computational approaches such as binding affinity calculations, computational alanine, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding affinity calculations show SARS-CoV-2 binds little more firmly to the hACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV. Analysis of simulation trajectories reveals that enhanced hydrophobic contacts or the van der Waals interaction play a major role in stabilizing the protein-protein interface. The major finding obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is that the RBD-ACE2 interface is populated with water molecules and interacts strongly with both RBD and ACE2 interfacial residues during the simulation periods. We also emphasize that the interfacial water molecules play a critical role in binding and maintaining the stability of the RBD/hACE2 complex.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, "all RBD-down" conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.', 'date': '2020-06-18', 'journal': ''}

There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat the spread of this coronavirus. Similarly, the development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy are critically needed. Molecular assays have been developed to determine viral genetic material present in patients. Serological assays have been developed to determine humoral responses to the spike protein or receptor binding domain (RBD). Detection of functional antibodies can be accomplished through neutralization of live SARS-CoV2 virus, but requires significant expertise, an infectible stable cell line, a specialized BioSafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. As large numbers of people return from quarantine, it is critical to have rapid diagnostics that can be widely adopted and employed to assess functional antibody levels in the returning workforce. This type of surrogate neutralization diagnostic can also be used to assess humoral immune responses induced in patients from the large number of vaccine and immunotherapy trials currently on-going.

Like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1: P4 and Munich: P1) were cultured twice in Vero-E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1: P6 and minor variants in the Munich: P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titers in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal.

Seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2 cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronaviruses.

Compared with the low-throughput PRNT (3 days), the SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay has substantially shorter turnaround time (5 hours) with a high-throughput testing capacity. Thus, the assay can be readily deployed for large-scale vaccine evaluation and neutralizing antibody testing in humans. Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2). When tested against this reporter virus, remdesivir exhibited substantially more potent activity in A549-hACE2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells (EC50 0.115 vs 1.28 M), while this difference was not observed for chloroquine (EC50 1.32 vs 3.52 M), underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate cells for antiviral testing.

Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors.

Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors.

Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text', 'date': '2020-07-02', 'journal': ''}

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text', 'date': '2020-07-02', 'journal': ''}

Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.

Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.', 'date': '2020-07-09', 'journal': ''}

Here we report the 3.5-[A] cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer.

BD-368-2 also triggers fusogenic-like structural rearrangements of the spike trimer, which could impede viral entry. Moreover, BD-368-2 completely avoids the common epitope of VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, evidenced by multiple crystal structures of their Fabs in tripartite complexes with RBD, suggesting a new way of pairing potent NAbs to prevent neutralization escape.

Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations.

Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota.

The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.', 'date': '2020-07-14', 'journal': ''}

Lead antibody 5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the "up" and the other in the "down" position, explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has become dominant worldwide.

So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.', 'date': '2020-07-17', 'journal': ''}

Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.', 'date': '2020-07-20', 'journal': ''}

IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and PBMCs from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBCs. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 in convalescent subjects were higher than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane.\n\nIMPORTANCERecent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key questions are whether humans have preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis focused on pre- and post-infection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs remain to mediate rapid antibody production. Our study also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation.', 'date': '2020-07-21', 'journal': ''}

Crucially, all that is required by our method are unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad hoc combinations of parameters/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein.\n\nOur results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex with anti- or nanobodies.

Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed but appear insufficient to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 unless two or three of them are being combined. Therefore, heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin, that have been used for decades to fight against infectious agents might represent a highly efficient alternative to the use of CP or mAbs in COVID-19 by targeting multiple antigen epitopes. However, conventional heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal 1,3-galactose (Gal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the genes coding for the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and 1,3-galactosyl-transferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and -Gal epitopes. We found that pig IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses, a drawback possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 or to avoiding a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Therefore, we immunized CMAH/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to elicit neutralizing antibodies.

The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spikes closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor.

S.; Palese, P.', 'abstract': 'Due to the lack of protective immunity of humans towards the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, this virus has caused a massive pandemic across the world resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a pre-fusion membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the major antigen that notably induces neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry. Many COVID-19 vaccines are under development, among them viral vectors expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit many benefits. Viral vector vaccines have the potential of being used as both live or inactivated vaccines and they can induce Th1 and Th2-based immune responses following different immunization regimens. Additionally, viral vector vaccines can be handled under BSL-2 conditions and they grow to high titers in cell cultures or other species restricted-hosts. For a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, several viral vectors are being tested, such as adenovirus, measles virus and Modified vaccinia Ankara.\n\nAdded value of this studyThe NDV vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 described in this study has advantages similar to those of other viral vector vaccines. But the NDV vector can be amplified in embryonated chicken eggs, which allows for high yields and low costs per dose. Also, the NDV vector is not a human pathogen, therefore the delivery of the foreign antigen would not be compromised by any pre-existing immunity in humans. Finally, NDV has a very good safety record in humans, as it has been used in many oncolytic virus trials. This study provides an important option for a cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study informs of the value of a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, for this NDV based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufactures in the U.S. and worldwide would have the capacity to rapidly produce hundreds of millions of doses to mitigate the consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.', 'date': '2020-07-26', 'journal': ''}

At one of these sites, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 response strongly and recurrently cross-reacts with the endemic virus hCoV-OC43.

Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.

Recent reports have raised the concern that antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients may not be long lasting and thus even these individuals may require vaccination. Vaccine candidates currently in clinical testing have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 wild type spike (S) protein (S-WT) as the major antigen of choice and while pre-clinical and early clinical testing have shown that S elicits an antibody response, we believe the optimal vaccine candidate should be capable of inducing robust, durable T-cell responses as well as humoral responses. We report here on a next generation bivalent human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) vaccine capable of inducing immunity in patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, comprising both an S sequence optimized for cell surface expression (S-Fusion) and a conserved nucleocapsid (N) antigen designed to be transported to the endosomal subcellular compartment, with the potential to generate durable immune protection. Our studies suggest that this bivalent vaccine is optimized for immunogenicity as evidenced by the following findings: (i) The optimized S-Fusion displayed improved S receptor binding domain (RBD) cell surface expression compared to S-WT where little surface expression was detected; (ii) the expressed RBD from S-Fusion retained conformational integrity and recognition by ACE2-Fc; (iii) the viral N protein modified with an enhanced T-cell stimulation domain (ETSD) localized to endosomal/lysosomal subcellular compartments for MHC I/II presentation; and (iv) these optimizations to S and N (S-Fusion and N-ETSD) generated enhanced de novo antigen-specific B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in antigen-naive pre-clinical models. Both the T-cell and antibody immune responses to S and N demonstrated a T-helper 1 (Th1) bias. The antibody responses were neutralizing as demonstrated by two independent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Based on these findings, we are advancing this next generation bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as our lead clinical candidate to test for its ability to provide robust, durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are ongoing to explore utilizing this vaccine construct in oral, intranasal, and sublingual formulations to induce mucosal immunity in addition to cell-mediated and humoral immunity.

Here, we extensively characterized antibodies of the SARS-CoV structural proteins for their cross-reactivity, experimental utility, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. We assessed a total of 10 antibodies (six for Spike, two for Membrane, and one for Nucleocapsid and Envelope viral protein). We evaluated the utility of these antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of assays, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, biolayer interferometry, western blots, and micro-neutralization. Remarkably, a high proportion of the antibodies we tested showed cross-reactivity, indicating a potentially generalizable theme of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These antibodies should help facilitate further research into SARS-CoV-2 basic biology.

Blocking this interaction provides a potent approach to preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, the ability of {beta}-chitosan to block the binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 was investigated. The inhibitory effect of {beta}-chitosan on inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was also studied. Native-PAGE analysis indicated that {beta}-chitosan could bind with ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2 could no longer bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. HPLC analysis suggested that a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD displayed high binding affinity without dissociation under high pressure (40 MPa) compared with that of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of Vero E6 cells and lungs from hACE2 mice showed that the presence of {beta}-chitosan prevented SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD from binding to ACE2. Meanwhile, {beta}-chitosan could dramatically suppress the inflammation caused by the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD both in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the decreased expression of ACE2 caused by {beta}-chitosan treatment was restored by addition of TAPI-1, an inhibitor of the transmembrane protease ADAM17. Our findings demonstrated that {beta}-chitosan displays an antibody-like function capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and effectively preventing the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. Moreover, ADAM17 activation induced by {beta}-chitosan treatment can enhance the cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2, releasing the active ectodomain into the extracellular environment, which can prevent the binding, internalization, and degradation of ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and thus diminish inflammation.

Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the 10-100 ng/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be pre-designed for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated or generated from convalescent patients.', 'date': '2020-08-01', 'journal': ''}

R.; Hwang, P.; Xu, J.; Stroud, R.', 'abstract': 'The design of an immunogenic scaffold that serves a role in treating a pathogen, and can be rapidly and predictively modeled, has remained an elusive feat. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence. These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK is designed to "uncloak" the viral ACE2 coating mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In summary, SARS-BLOCK peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than blunted.', 'date': '2020-08-06', 'journal': ''}

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.', 'date': '2020-08-10', 'journal': ''}

Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment.

The dynamics of vascular damage, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro models are typically epithelial cell monocultures or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology. We use a vascularised lung-on-chip model where, consistent with monoculture reports, low numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virions are released apically from alveolar epithelial cells. However, rapid infection of the underlying endothelial layer leads to the generation of clusters of endothelial cells with low or no CD31 expression, a progressive loss of endothelial barrier integrity, and a pro-coagulatory microenvironment. These morphological changes do not occur if these cells are exposed to the virus apically. Viral RNA persists in individual cells, which generates a response that is skewed towards NF-KB mediated inflammation, is typified by IL-6 secretion even in the absence of immune cells, and is transient in epithelial cells but persistent in endothelial cells. Perfusion with Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of trans IL-6 signalling slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not prevent the formation of endothelial cell clusters with reduced CD31 expression. SARS-CoV-2 mediated endothelial cell damage occurs despite a lack of rapid viral replication, in a cell-type specific manner and independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.', 'date': '2020-08-12', 'journal': ''}

SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens.

In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic.

Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F, etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly.

Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 caused disease (COVID-19). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants, for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity.

Further species were shown to be susceptible under experimental conditions. The extent of natural infections of animals, however, is still largely unknown. Serological methods will be useful tools for tracing SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals once test systems are validated for use in different species. Here, we developed an indirect multi-species ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The newly established ELISA was validated using 59 sera of infected or vaccinated animals including ferrets, raccoon dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, cattle and a cat, and a total of 220 antibody-negative sera of the same animal species. Overall, a diagnostic specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 98.31% was achieved, and the functionality with every species included in this study could be demonstrated.

Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site ({Delta}PRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the {Delta}PRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the {Delta}PRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT50 titers.

Small protein antigens typically induce weak immune response while particles measuring tens of nanometers are efficiently presented to B cell follicles and subsequently to follicular germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes, where B cell proliferation and affinity maturation occurs.

Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of S{Delta}C-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with S{Delta}C-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups.

In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein.

This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19.

Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to "up" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both "up" and "down" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize "up" and "down" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only "up" RBDs9.

In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery.

RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response.

Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an "up" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus.

For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention.

Thus, secretory IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.', 'date': '2020-09-09', 'journal': ''}

Although numerous drug and vaccine developments efforts are underway, many questions remain outstanding on the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and entry in the cell. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular Spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domain-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer, and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.\n\nStatement of SignificanceAs the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has been the subject of extensive structural and antibody design efforts in aims to curtail COVID-19 spread. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the homodimer ACE2 full-length structure to study the dynamics of this protein in the context of the cellular membrane. The simulations evidence exceptional plasticity in the protein structure due to flexible hinge motions in the head-transmembrane domain linker region and helix mobility in the membrane, resulting in a varied ensemble of conformations distinct from the experimental structures.

First, we showed that a codon optimized version of the S protein could migrate efficiently to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter version of S in its C-terminal domain ({Delta}S) in 293 cells that express MLV Gag-Pol (293GP). The incorporation of {Delta}S was 15-times more efficient into VLPs as compared to the full-length version, and that was not due to steric interference between the S cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid. Indeed, a similar result was also observed with extracellular vesicles released from parental 293 and 293GP cells. The amount of {Delta}S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was robust, with an estimated 1.25 g/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2).

Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-{gamma}-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three pattern types that varied sequentially, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nImportanceFor the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking the hydrophobic surface of RBD via neutralizing antibodies could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.', 'date': '2020-09-21', 'journal': ''}

CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD. In one of these conformations, quaternary interactions are made by CR3022 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of an adjacent subunit.

Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a  seed gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells.

The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determines severity/fatality.

We searched GEO and ArrayExpress that provided many publicly available gene expression data that objectively measure the host immune response in diverse conditions. However, challenges remain in identifying a set of host response events that are common to every condition. There are no studies that provide a reproducible assessment of prognosticators of disease severity, the host response, and therapeutic goals. Consequently, therapeutic trials for COVID-19 have seen many more  misses than  hits. This work used multiple (> 45,000) gene expression datasets from GEO and ArrayExpress and analyzed them using an unbiased computational approach that relies upon fundamentals of gene expression patterns and mathematical precision when assessing them.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis work identifies a signature that is surprisingly conserved in all viral pandemics, including Covid-19, inspiring the nomenclature ViP-signature. A subset of 20-genes classified disease severity in respiratory pandemics. The ViP signatures pinpointed the nature and source of the  cytokine storm mounted by the host. They also helped formulate precise therapeutic goals and rationalized the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe ViP signatures provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for assessing the immune response in viral pandemics when creating pre-clinical models; they serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet candidate drugs.', 'date': '2020-09-22', 'journal': ''}

Simple and effective strategies to increase potency are desirable for such studies when antibodies are only modestly effective. Here, we identify and characterize a high-affinity synthetic nanobody (sybody, SR31) as a fusion partner to improve the potency of RBM-antibodies. Crystallographic studies reveal that SR31 binds to RBD at a conserved and  greasy site distal to RBM. Although SR31 distorts RBD at the interface, it does not perturb the RBM conformation, hence displaying no neutralizing activities itself. However, fusing SR31 to two modestly neutralizing sybodies dramatically increases their affinity for RBD and neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

F.; Nicolaus, T.; Schendel, L. C.; Gaub, H. E.; Lipfert, J.', 'abstract': 'The current COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating global impact and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells through interaction of its receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. RBD binding to ACE2 is a critical first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral attachment occurs in dynamic environments where forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play central roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using specific molecular handles, we tether the fusion proteins between a functionalized flow cell surface and magnetic beads in magnetic tweezers. We observe repeated interactions of RBD and ACE2 under constant loads and can fully quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the binding interaction. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, a larger free energy of binding, and a lower off-rate than that of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agents of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. In the absence of force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rapidly (within [&le;]1 ms) engages the ACE2 receptor if held in close proximity and remains bound to ACE2 for 400-800 s, much longer than what has been reported for other viruses engaging their cellular receptors. We anticipate that our assay will be a powerful tool investigate the roles of mutations in the RBD that might alter the infectivity of the virus and to test the modes of action of neutralizing antibodies and other agents designed to block RBD binding to ACE2 that are currently developed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.', 'date': '2020-09-28', 'journal': ''}

To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein.

Here, we describe a construct and protocol for the expression and purification of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) labeled 2019-nCoV spike RBD.

We stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Following expansion of the cells, the fusion protein was secreted from adherent cells into serum-free medium. Ni-NTA IMAC purification resulted in very high protein purity, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE.

A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine, VSV{Delta}G-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients.

A.; El-Baba, T. J.; Bolla, J. R.; Robinson, C. V.', 'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most immunogenic of the structural proteins and plays essential roles in several stages of the virus lifecycle. It is comprised of two major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes proteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. In addition, we found the C-terminal proteoform N156-419 generated the highest antibody response in convalescent plasma from patients >6 months from initial COVID-19 diagnosis when compared to the other proteoforms.

To understand the differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs.

As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemically inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 {+/-} 1.4 mg/L of culture medium was confirmed. SDS-PAGE and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a single structure, unlike that produced in Escherichia coli.

However, the immunological understanding of this viral infection is limited. Currently, several vaccines are being developed to help limit transmission and prevent the current pandemic. However, basic understanding of the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections is needed to inform further vaccine development and to understand the protective properties of the developed immune response. We investigated, the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections in recovered patients experiencing a full spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infections to severe cases requiring hospitalization. We used a novel multiplex serological platform, cell-based neutralization assays and dextramer flow cytometry assays to characterize a broad and robust humoral and cellular immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. We found that the vast majority of recovered individuals have clear detectable and functional SARS-CoV-2 spike specific adaptive immune responses, despite diverse disease severities.

In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs.

The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) associated region of the nucleocapsid protein are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals four distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region- specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March-July, during a period of stasis in terms of inter- regional diversity. Finally, beginning July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control and ultimately end the pandemic. We analyzed more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of January 2021 and demonstrate adaptive evolution of the virus that affects, primarily, multiple sites in the spike and nucleocapsid protein. Selection appears to act on combinations of mutations in these and other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Evolution of the virus is accompanied by ongoing adaptive diversification within and between geographic regions. This diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.', 'date': '2020-10-16', 'journal': ''}

PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 is a polypeptide vaccine containing nine 30-mer peptides derived from all four major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins; 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals. Extrapolation of the above findings to a US bone marrow donor cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities (n=1,000 each ethnic group) suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination in a general population will likely elicit broad, multi-antigenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity, including Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) cohorts.', 'date': '2020-10-16', 'journal': ''}

Here, ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide-range of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the ICU, requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within six days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to quantitate each patients comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies, scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 Likelihood Ratio (96.7% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information could guide more effective therapeutic intervention.\n\nSignificance statementThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide. Despite efforts to fight the virus, the disease continues to overwhelm hospitals with severely ill patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is readily accomplished through a multitude of reliable testing platforms; however, prognostic prediction remains elusive. To this end, we identified a short epitope from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and also a disease risk factor score based upon comorbidities and age. The presence of antibodies specifically binding to this epitope plus a score cutoff can predict severe COVID-19 outcomes with 96.7% specificity.', 'date': '2020-10-16', 'journal': ''}

We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibody.

Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials.

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection.\n\nStudy Design and MethodsTo extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors.\n\nResults and ConclusionWe found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations, but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.', 'date': '2020-10-20', 'journal': ''}

After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFN{gamma} expression, were up-regulated.

While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable / less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound-library that is focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel drug-like compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50s of 0.2-3.0 M); whereas, control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity.

Selected promising compounds inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50s (6-30 M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for coronavirus attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.', 'date': '2020-10-22', 'journal': ''}

Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge.

Neutralization occurs via a binding epitope that maps within the ACE2 interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, conserved across all common circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, SC31 demonstrated potent survival benefit by dramatically reducing viral load concomitant with attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to severe systemic disease, such as IL-6. Comparison with a Fc-null LALA variant of SC31 demonstrated that optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires intact Fc-mediated effector functions that can further induce an IFN{gamma}-driven anti-viral immune response. Dose-dependent efficacy for SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when dosed before the activation of lung inflammatory responses. Importantly, despite Fc{gamma}R binding, no evidence of antibody dependent enhancement was observed with the Fc-competent SC31 even at sub-therapeutic doses. Therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, where SC31 again significantly reduced viral load, decreased lung lesions and inhibited progression to severe disease manifestations.

We now have extended our in vivo studies of STI-2020 to include disease treatment efficacy, profiling of biodistribution of STI-2020 in mice when antibody is delivered intranasally (IN) or intravenously (IV), as well as pharmacokinetics in mice following IN antibody administration. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters were treated with STI-2020 using these routes, and treatment effects on severity and duration of COVID-19-like disease in this model were evaluated. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, treatment with STI-2020 12 hours post-infection using the IN route led to a decrease in severity of clinical disease signs and a more robust recovery during 9 days of infection as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody. Treatment via the IV route using the same dose and timing regimen resulted in a decrease in the average number of consecutive days that infected animals experienced weight loss, shortening the duration of disease and allowing recovery to begin more rapidly in STI-2020 treated animals. Following IN administration in mice, STI-2020 was detected within 10 minutes in both lung tissue and lung lavage. The half-life of STI-2020 in lung tissue is approximately 25 hours. We are currently investigating the minimum effective dose of IN-delivered STI-2020 in the hamster model as well as establishing the relative benefit of delivering neutralizing antibodies by both IV and IN routes.', 'date': '2020-10-29', 'journal': ''}

In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticles vaccine candidates, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer) and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), with the application of covalent bond linking by SpyTag-SpyCatcher system.

A.; Teng, K. W.; Tada, T.; Landau, N. R.; Koide, S.', 'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat, and host immunity remains the main mechanism of protection against the disease. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.', 'date': '2020-11-03', 'journal': ''}

Our aim was to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine offering a wide range of multi-epitope determinants important for the immune system including not only the spike (S) protein but also the envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We designed a semi-split vaccine prototype consisting of S protein-depleted viral particles and free S protein. Next, we investigated its immunogenic potential in BALB/c mice. The animals were immunized intradermally or intramuscularly with the dose adjusted with buffer or addition of aluminum hydroxide, respectively. The antibody response was evaluated by plasma analysis at 7 days after the first or second dose. The immune cell response was studied by flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes. The data showed a very early onset of both S protein-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies at 90% inhibition regardless of the route of vaccine administration. However, significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in the intradermally (geometric mean titer - GMT of 7.8 {+/-} 1.4) than in the intramuscularly immunized mice (GMT of 6.2 {+/-} 1.5). In accordance with this, stimulation of cellular immunity by the semi-split vaccine was suggested by elevated levels of B and T lymphocyte subpopulations in the murine spleens. These responses were more predominant in the intradermally immunized mice compared with the intramuscular route of administration. The upward trend in the levels of plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, including follicular helper T cells, was confirmed even in mice receiving the vaccine intradermally at a dose of 0.5 g.\n\nWe demonstrated that the semi-split vaccine is capable of eliciting both humoral and cellular immunity early after vaccination.

Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by five-fold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months after coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) onset, using immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers.

After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay.

We cloned L-SIGN as a specific receptor for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The RBD of the spike protein did not bind to L-SIGN.

Potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies derived from closely related antibody heavy chain genes (IGHV3-53 or 3-66) have been isolated from multiple COVID-19 convalescent individuals. These usually contain minimal somatic mutations and bind the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) to interfere with attachment to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used antigen-specific single B cell sorting to isolate S-reactive monoclonal antibodies from the blood of a COVID-19 convalescent individual. The seven most potent neutralizing antibodies were somatic variants of the same IGHV3-53-derived antibody and bind the RBD with varying affinity. We report X-ray crystal structures of four Fab variants bound to the RBD and use the structures to explain the basis for changes in RBD affinity. We show that a germline revertant antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizes virus, and that gains in affinity for the RBD do not necessarily correlate with increased neutralization potency, suggesting that somatic mutation is not required to exert robust antiviral effect.

Several novel methods for preparing vaccine candidates are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in response to the urgent need to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In many cases, these methods rely on new approaches for vaccine production and immune stimulation. We report on the use of a novel method (SolaVAX) for production of an inactivated vaccine candidate and the testing of that candidate in a hamster animal model for its ability to prevent infection upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The studies employed in this work included an evaluation of the levels of neutralizing antibody produced post-vaccination, levels of specific antibody sub-types to RBD and spike protein that were generated, evaluation of viral shedding post-challenge, flow cytometric and single cell sequencing data on cellular fractions and histopathological evaluation of tissues post-challenge. The results from this study provide insight into the immunological responses occurring as a result of vaccination with the proposed vaccine candidate and the impact that adjuvant formulations, specifically developed to promote Th1 type immune responses, have on vaccine efficacy and protection against infection following challenge with live SARS-CoV-2. This data may have utility in the development of effective vaccine candidates broadly. Furthermore, the results suggest that preparation of a whole virion vaccine for COVID-19 using this specific photochemical method may have utility in the preparation of one such vaccine candidate.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have developed a vaccine for COVID-19 which is prepared by a novel method for inactivation of a whole virion particle and tested it in a hamster animal model for its ability to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'date': '2020-11-13', 'journal': ''}

Coronavirus Spikes are large, heavily glycosylated, homotrimeric complexes, with inherent instability. Their poor manufacturability now threatens availability of these proteins for vaccines and diagnostic tests. Here, we outline a scalable, GMP-compliant, chemically defined process for production of a cell secreted, stabilized form of the trimeric Spike protein.

However, it is not known if ACIS KEPTIDE attenuates the entry of SARS-CoV2 virus in vivo in lung and kidney tissues, protects health, and prevent death once applied through intranasal route. In our current manuscript, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of SARS-CoV2 (1*106) strongly induced the expression of ACE-2, promoted the entry of virions into the lung and kidney cells, caused acute histopathological toxicities, and mortality (28%). Interestingly, thirty-minutes of pre-treatment with 50 g/Kg Body weight ACIS normalized the expression of ACE-2 via receptor internalization, strongly mitigated that viral entry, and prevented mortality suggesting its prospect as a prophylactic therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. On the contrary, the peptide backbone of ACIS was unable to normalize the expression of ACE-2, failed to improve the health vital signs and histopathological abnormalities.

Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab), but no vaccines, are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication.

Their descendants have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses, due to a proofreading polymerase. In the spike glycoprotein, we find recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.', 'date': '2020-11-19', 'journal': ''}

C.', 'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a global pandemic and vaccines are being rapidly developed. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To assess the durability of immunity, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-primary infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets against infection, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.\n\nImportanceThe SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.', 'date': '2020-11-22', 'journal': ''}

According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious.

The initial development and characterization experiments are presented along with proof-of-concept studies for the vaccine candidate UB-612. UB-612 consists of eight components rationally designed for induction of potently neutralizing antibodies and broad T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2: the S1-RBD-sFc fusion protein, six synthetic peptides (one universal peptide and five SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides), a proprietary CpG TLR-9 agonist at low concentration as an excipient, and aluminum phosphate adjuvant. Through immunogenicity studies in Guinea pigs and rats, we optimized the design of protein/peptide immunogens and selected an adjuvant system, yielding a vaccine that provides excellent S1-RBD binding and high neutralizing antibody responses, robust cellular responses, and a Th1-oriented response at low doses. In challenge studies, UB- 612 vaccination reduced viral load and prevented development of disease in mouse and non-human primate challenge models. With a Phase 1 trial completed, a Phase 2 trial ongoing in Taiwan, and additional trials planned to support global authorizations, UB-612 is a highly promising and differentiated vaccine candidate for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally since its origin in 2019, causing an unprecedented public health crisis that has resulted in greater than 4.7 million deaths worldwide. Many vaccines are under development to limit disease spread and reduce the number of cases, but additional candidates that promote a robust immune response are needed. Here, we describe a multitope protein-peptide vaccine platform that is unique among COVID-19 vaccines. The advantages of our approach are induction of both high levels of neutralizing antibodies as well as a Th/CTL response in the vaccinated host, which mimics the immune response that occurs after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that our vaccine is immunogenic and effective in preventing disease in several animal models, including AAV- hACE-2 transduced mice, and both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Importantly, no immunopathology was observed in the lungs of immunized animals, therefore showing that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) does not occur. Our study provides an additional, novel vaccine candidate for advancement in clinical trials to treat and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.', 'date': '2020-11-30', 'journal': ''}

Herein, we detected circulating exosomes that express the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in plasma of both healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that exosomal ACE2 competes with cellular ACE2 for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2-expressing (ACE2+) exosomes blocked the binding of the viral spike (S) protein RBD to ACE2+ cells in a dose dependent manner, which was 400- to 700-fold more potent than that of vesicle-free recombinant human ACE2 extracellular domain protein (rhACE2). As a consequence, exosomal ACE2 prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus tethering and infection of human host cells at a 50-150 fold higher efficacy than rhACE2. A similar antiviral activity of exosomal ACE2 was further demonstrated to block wild-type live SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, while the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity. The sensitivity of all antigen-specific antibody isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 days post-symptom onset.

A multi-antigen immunoassay to define the complex serological landscape and clinical associations is essential.\n\nMethodsWe developed a multiplex immunoassay and evaluated serum/plasma from adults with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during acute illness (N=52) and convalescence (N=69); and pre-pandemic (N=106) and post-pandemic (N=137) healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N), Spike domain 1 (S1), receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain (S1-NTD).\n\nResultsTo diagnose infection, the combined [IgA+IgG+IgM] or IgG for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded AUC values -0.90 by ROC curves. From days 6-30 post-symptom onset, the levels of antigen-specific IgG, IgA or [IgA+IgG+IgM] were higher in patients with severe/critical compared to mild/moderate infections. Consistent with excessive concentrations of antibodies, a strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients. Notably, mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared to severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 months.\n\nConclusionThis SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity and kinetics of the antibody response against multiple viral antigens. The IgG and combined-isotype SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay is highly diagnostic of acute and convalescent disease and may prognosticate severity early in illness.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn contrast to patients with moderate infections, those with severe COVID-19 develop prominent, early antibody responses to S1 and N proteins.', 'date': '2020-12-06', 'journal': ''}

Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies that search for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD. However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and is therefore a hotspot for drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and residues distant to it in the spike protein. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular recognition events and prediction of the highest-effect key mutations in distant, allosteric sites, with implications for therapeutics. Also, these sites can appear in emerging mutants with possibly higher transmissibility and virulence, and pre-identifying them can give clues for designing pancoronavirus vaccines against future outbreaks. Our model, based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Residues involved in the most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab-initio from our model. Conversely, broad spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal antibodies can target these key distant-but-conserved regions of the spike protein.\n\nSignificance StatementThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic resulted in the largest public health crisis in recent times. Significant drug design effort against SARS-CoV-2 is focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, although this region is highly prone to mutations causing therapeutic resistance. We applied deep data analysis methods on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to identify key non-RBD residues that play a crucial role in spike-receptor binding and infection. textcol-orredBecause the non-RBD residues are typically conserved across multiple coronaviruses, they can be targeted by broad spectrum antibodies and drugs to treat infections from new strains that might appear during future epidemics.', 'date': '2020-12-08', 'journal': ''}

Designing immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to conserved viral epitopes on the major surface glycoprotein, spike, such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) is one potential approach. Here, we report the generation of homotrimeric RBD immunogens from different sarbecoviruses using a stabilized, immune-silent trimerization tag. In mice, we find that a cocktail of these homotrimeric sarbecovirus RBDs elicits antibodies to conserved viral epitopes outside of the ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM). Importantly, these responses neutralize all sarbecovirus components even in context of prior SARS-CoV-2 imprinting. We further show that a substantial fraction of the neutralizing antibodies elicited after vaccination in humans also engages non-RBM epitopes on the RBD. Collectively, our results suggest a strategy for eliciting broadly neutralizing responses leading to a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.\n\nAuthor summaryImmunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the human population will be widespread due to natural infection and vaccination. However, another novel coronavirus will likely emerge in the future and may cause a subsequent pandemic. Humoral responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination provide limited protection against even closely related coronaviruses. We show immunization with a cocktail of trimeric coronavirus receptor binding domains induces a neutralizing antibody response that is broadened to related coronaviruses with pandemic potential. Importantly, this broadening occurs in context of an initial imprinted SARS-CoV-2 spike immunization showing that preexisting immunity can be expanded to recognize other related coronaviruses. Our immunogens focused the serum antibody response to conserved epitopes on the receptor binding domain outside of the ACE2 receptor binding motif; this contrasts with current SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic antibodies, which predominantly target the receptor binding motif.', 'date': '2020-12-08', 'journal': ''}

The effect of somatic mutations accumulated during affinity maturation process on flexibility, stability and affinity of the germline and affinity matured nanobody was studied. Affinity maturation results in loss of local flexibility in CDR of H3 and this resulted in a gain of affinity towards the antigen. Further affinity maturation was found to destabilize the nanobody. Mechanistically the loss of flexibility of the CDR H3 is due to the redistribution of hydrogen bond network due to somatic mutation A50T, also this contributes significantly to the destability of the nanobody. Unlike antibody, in nanobody the framework region is highly conserved and structural diversity in CDR is the determining factor in diverse antigen binding and also a factor contributing to the stability.

We here describe the development of novel COVID-19 DNA plasmid vaccines encoding homodimers consisting of a targeting unit that binds chemokine receptors on antigen-presenting cells (human MIP-1 /LD78{beta}), a dimerization unit (derived from the hinge and CH3 exons of human IgG3), and an antigenic unit (Spike or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2). The candidate encoding the longest RBD variant (VB2060) demonstrated high secretion of a functional protein and induced rapid and dose-dependent RBD IgG antibody responses that persisted up to at least 3 months after a single dose of the vaccine in mice. Neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against the live virus were detected from day 7 after one dose. All tested dose regimens reached titers that were higher or comparable to those seen in sera from human convalescent COVID-19 patients from day 28. T cell responses were detected already at day 7, and were subsequently characterized to be multifunctional CD8+ and Th1 dominated CD4+ T cells.

These findings, together with the simplicity and scalability of plasmid DNA manufacturing, safety data on the vaccine platform in clinical trials, low cost of goods, data indicating potential long term storage at +2{degrees} to 8{degrees}C and simple administration, suggests the VB2060 candidate is a promising second generation candidate to prevent COVID-19.', 'date': '2020-12-09', 'journal': ''}

K.; Mir, R. A.; Sinha, S.; Luthra, K.', 'abstract': 'Cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are similar epitopes on viruses that are recognized or neutralized by same antibodies. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic profile.\n\nImportanceIn the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be a critical feature of recovered patients. HIV-1 bnAbs recognize extensively diverse cross-reactive epitopes and tolerate diversity within their core epitope. Given the unique nature of HIV-1 bnAbs and their ability to recognize and/or accommodate viral glycans, we reasoned that the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be targeted by HIV-1 specific bnAbs. Herein, we showed that HIV-1 specific antibodies cross-react and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Understanding cross-reactive neutralization epitopes of antibodies generated in divergent viral infections will provide key evidence for engineering so called super-antibodies (antibodies that can potently neutralize diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features). Such cross-reactive antibodies can provide a blueprint upon which synthetic variants can be generated in the face of future pandemics.', 'date': '2020-12-10', 'journal': ''}

To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the spike protein are able to prevent antibody binding, yet while maintaining the ability to bind ACE2 and viral infectivity, mutations in the spike protein identified in cases of human infection were mapped to the crystallographically-determined interfaces between the spike protein and ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J), antibody CC12.1 (PDB entry 6XC2), and antibody P2B-2F6 (PDB entry 7BWJ).\n\nBoth antibody binding interfaces partially overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Among 16 mutations that map to the RBD:CC12.1 interface, 11 are likely to disrupt CC12.1 binding but not ACE2 binding. Among 12 mutations that map to the RBD:P2B-2F6 interface, 8 are likely to disrupt P2B-2F6 binding but not ACE2 binding. As expected, none of the mutations observed to date appear likely to disrupt the RBD:ACE2 interface.\n\nWe conclude that SARS-CoV-2 with mutated forms of the spike protein may retain the ability to bind ACE2 while evading recognition by antibodies that arise in response to the original wild-type form of the spike protein. It seems likely that immune evasion will be possible regardless of whether the spike protein was encountered in the form of infectious virus, or as the immunogen in a vaccine. Therefore, it also seems likely that reinfection with a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among people who recover from Covid-19, and that vaccines with the ability to generate antibodies against multiple variant forms of the spike protein will be necessary to protect against variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 that are already circulating in the human population.', 'date': '2020-12-13', 'journal': ''}

We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the NTD alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the RBD but not the NTD had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks. These data support the utility of spike subunit-based antigens as a vaccine for use in humans.', 'date': '2020-12-21', 'journal': ''}

The viral Spike protein serves the basis for many putative therapeutic countermeasures including vaccines, blocking and neutralizing antibodies, and decoy receptors. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. The Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues conserved among coronavirus. Increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation, while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced the ability of the human CoV 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase using the pharmacological inhibitor TVB-3166 eliminated palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 Spike. Additionally, TVB-3166 attenuated plaque formation and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine CoV infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infections.', 'date': '2020-12-21', 'journal': ''}

By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody.

Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to the containment, vaccine exploration and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, when unusual temperature dependence was discovered from the 1550cm-1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, with the relative absorbance matches at 37{degrees}C the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs 12). Meanwhile the ratio of bonds at 27{degrees}C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials rather than by the laymans guess, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. As a result, the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody will be more conclusive beyond 31{degrees}C, instead of at the usual room temperature of 20{degrees}C - 25{degrees}C, when the vaccine research and antibody diagnosis would likely be undermined. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37{degrees}C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, are not only of clinical significance in particular, but also of a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of the vaccine-antibody interactions in general.', 'date': '2020-12-21', 'journal': ''}

However, these pseudoviruses contain structural proteins foreign to SARS-CoV-2, and require days to infect and express reporter genes15.

T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population.

While the lack of an effective antiviral treatment inadvertently increases the interest in CP products, initial clinical evaluation on COVID-19 patients revealed that critical factors determining the outcome of CP therapy need to be defined clearly if clinical efficacy is to be expected. Measurement of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 using wildtype virus presents a reliable functional assay but the availability of suitable BSL3 facilities for virus culture restricts its applicability.

Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro.

This includes production at the 1 and 5 L scale in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, and the comparison of three different chromatographic purification methods. This culminated in the selection of a process to produce RBD219-N1C1 with a yield of >400 mg per liter of fermentation with >92% purity and >39% target product recovery after purification. In addition, we show the results from analytical studies, including SEC-HPLC, DLS, and an ACE2 receptor binding assay that were performed to characterize the purified proteins to select the best purification process. Finally, we propose an optimized upstream fermentation and downstream purification process that generates quality RBD219-N1C1 protein antigen and is fully scalable at a low cost.', 'date': '2020-12-30', 'journal': ''}

Nucleoside-modified mRNAs formulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) have proved to be a potent mode of immunization against infectious diseases in preclinical studies, and are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 in humans. A critical question is how mRNA-LNP vaccine immunogenicity compares to that of traditional adjuvanted protein vaccines in primates. Here, we found that mRNA-LNP immunization compared to protein immunization elicited either the same or superior magnitude and breadth of HIV-1 Env-specific polyfunctional antibodies. Immunization with mRNA-LNP encoding Zika premembrane and envelope (prM-E) or HIV-1 Env gp160 induced durable neutralizing antibodies for at least 41 weeks. Doses of mRNA-LNP as low as 5 g were immunogenic in macaques. Thus, mRNA-LNP can be used to rapidly generate single or multi-component vaccines, such as sequential vaccines needed to protect against HIV-1 infection.

Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was abortive in immunized animals.\n\nSignificanceVaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards. Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials, though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity. The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer.

A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via Fc{gamma}RII receptor engagement.

Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein might have enhanced the viral proteins binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC="FIGDIR/small/425316v1_ufig1.gif" ALT="Figure 1">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1231e91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@abf67dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c3a288org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e3ab52_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG', 'date': '2021-01-05', 'journal': ''}

This fusion protein demonstrated a neutralization efficiency nearly 250-fold greater than monomeric sACE2. SunTag in combination with a more potent version of sACE2 achieved near complete neutralization at a sub-nanomolar range, which is comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies.

Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro-derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo-like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF.

These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2.

As the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future combination therapy.', 'date': '2021-01-07', 'journal': ''}

All three utilized VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy chain N53I enhancing binding and light chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bound both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies utilizing elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD - a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 [A]. The VH1-2-antibody class thus utilizes modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDetermine structures of VH1-2-derived antibodies 2-43, 2-15, and H4 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike\nC_LIO_LIDefine a multi-donor VH1-2-antibody class with modular components for RBD and quaternary recognition\nC_LIO_LIReveal structural basis of RBD-up and RBD-down recognition within the class\nC_LIO_LIShow somatic hypermutations and avidity to be critical for potency\nC_LIO_LIDelineate changes in spike conformation induced by CDRH3-mediated quaternary recognition\nC_LI', 'date': '2021-01-11', 'journal': ''}

Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MVA-SARS-2-S is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial as aspirant for developing a safe and efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nSignificance StatementThe highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S, a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation. When administered by intramuscular inoculation, MVA-SARS-2-S expresses and safely delivers the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing balanced SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity, and protective efficacy in vaccinated mice. Substantial clinical experience has already been gained with MVA vectors using homologous and heterologous prime-boost applications, including the immunization of children and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, MVA-SARS-2-S represents an important resource for developing further optimized COVID-19 vaccines.', 'date': '2021-01-11', 'journal': ''}

In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.\n\nContactbahar@pitt.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.', 'date': '2021-01-11', 'journal': ''}

To be able to assess the risk of viral escape from neutralization by first-wave antibodies, we leveraged our capability for Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation of the spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and its binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to predict alterations in molecular interactions resulting from the presence of the E484K, K417N, and N501Y variants found in the South African 501Y.V2 strain - alone and in combination. We report here the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y results in the highest degree of conformational alterations of S RBD when bound to hACE2, compared to either E484K or N501Y alone. Both E484K and N501Y increase affinity of S RBD for hACE2 and E484K in particular switches the charge on the flexible loop region of RBD which leads to the formation of novel favorable contacts. Enhanced affinity of S RBD for hACE2 very likely underpins the greater transmissibility conferred by the presence of either E484K or N501Y; while the induction of conformational changes may provide an explanation for evidence that the 501Y.V2 variant, distinguished from the B.1.1.7 UK variant by the presence of E484K, is able to escape neutralization by existing first-wave anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and re-infect COVID-19 convalescent individuals.', 'date': '2021-01-13', 'journal': ''}

We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs flexibility and how this flexibility impacts the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the Fabs is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich ELISA, we show the rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity.

S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described that act against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies will depend upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving, circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, while avoiding the risk of antibody dependent enhancement as observed with other Coronavirus vaccines. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer that is arrested in the closed state to prevent exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with the receptor. We compared this with a range of other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induce a long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody response as well as T-cell responses. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralising responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, virus-inhibiting immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.', 'date': '2021-01-14', 'journal': ''}

Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants, though the current therapeutic options remain limited and expensive. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response.

Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its D614G mutant. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, therefore would be more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G mutant. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently published CR3022-CAR-NK cells.

In this study, we used coevolutionary analysis, molecular simulations, and perturbation-based hierarchical network modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes with H014, S309, S2M11 and S2E12 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to explore molecular mechanisms underlying binding-induced modulation of dynamics, stability and allosteric signaling in the spike protein trimers. The results of this study revealed key regulatory centers that can govern allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Through coevolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we identified highly coevolving hotspots and functional clusters forming coevolutionary networks. The results revealed significant coevolutionary couplings between functional regions separated by the medium-range distances which may help to facilitate a functional cross-talk between distant allosteric regions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with antibodies. We also discovered a potential mechanism by which antibody-specific targeting of coevolutionary centers can allow for efficient modulation of allosteric interactions and signal propagation between remote functional regions. Using a hierarchical network modeling and perturbation-response scanning analysis, we demonstrated that binding of antibodies could leverage direct contacts with coevolutionary hotspots to allosterically restore and enhance couplings between spatially separated functional regions, thereby protecting the spike apparatus from membrane fusion. The results of this study also suggested that antibody binding can induce a switch from a moderately cooperative population-shift mechanism, governing structural changes of the ligand-free SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, to antibody-induced highly cooperative mechanism that can better withstand mutations in the functional regions without significant deleterious consequences for protein function. This study provides a novel insight into allosteric regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, showing that antibodies can modulate allosteric interactions and signaling of spike proteins, providing a plausible strategy for therapeutic intervention by targeting specific hotspots of allosteric interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.', 'date': '2021-01-20', 'journal': ''}

However the immunogenicity of the vector itself decreases its effectiveness as a boosting vaccine due to the induction of strong anti-vector neutralising immunity. Here we determined how dissolvable microneedle patches (DMN) for skin immunization can overcome this issue, using a clinically-relevant adenovirus-based Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, AdHu5-PfRH5, in mice. Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form. Conventional high dose repeated immunization by the intramuscular (IM) route induced low antigen-specific IgG titres and high anti-vector immunity. A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5-PfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response. It also provides a method of stabilising adenovirus vaccine, in easy-to-administer dissolvable microneedle patches, permitting storage and distribution out of cold chain.', 'date': '2021-01-21', 'journal': ''}

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100g of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at ~1/300.

In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance. Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period.

These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased, function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.', 'date': '2021-01-28', 'journal': ''}

R.', 'abstract': 'Biochemical phenotypes are major indexes for protein structure and function characterization. They are determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids and may be reflected in the protein three-dimensional structure. Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes is a critical step for understanding protein function and disease mechanism as well as enabling drug discovery. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2s spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain - both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction. We observed concordance of the DMS data and our neural network predictions with an independent study on intermolecular interactions from molecular dynamics (multiple 500 ns or 1 s all-atom) simulations of the spike protein-ACE2 interface, with critical implications for the use of deep learning to dissect molecular mechanisms. The mutation- or genetically-determined component of a biochemical phenotype estimated from the neural networks has improved causal inference properties relative to the original phenotype and can facilitate crucial insights into disease pathophysiology and therapeutic design.', 'date': '2021-01-28', 'journal': ''}

COV2-2196 forms an "aromatic cage" at the heavy/light chain interface using germline-encoded residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals1-4. The structure of COV2-2130 reveals that an unusually long LCDR1 and HCDR3 make interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of COV2-2196. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the critical residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern for possible viral escape. Nonetheless, both COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 showed strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain with recent variations of concern including E484K, N501Y, and D614G substitutions.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 g of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 g or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice.

These mAbs recognize epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is considered to represent the main rout of receptor engagement by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recent emergence of viral variants emphasizes the notion that efficient antibody treatments need to rely on mAbs against several distinct key epitopes in order to circumvent the occurrence of therapy escape-mutants. Here we report the isolation and characterization of 12 neutralizing mAbs, identified by screening a phage-display library constructed from lymphatic cells collected from severe COVID-19 patients. The antibodies target three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2, one of them defining a major site of vulnerability of the virus. Extensive characterization of these mAbs suggests a neutralization mechanism which relies both on amino-acid and N-glycan recognition on the virus, and involvement of receptors other than the hACE2 on the target cell. Two of the selected mAbs, which demonstrated superior neutralization potency in vitro, were further evaluated in vivo, demonstrating their ability to fully protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice even when administered at low doses and late after infection.

To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ~45% showed neutralizing activity of which ~20% were NTD-specific. None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies.\n\nSeveral monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development have been shown to lose potency against some SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against novel emerging variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multispecific DARPin(R) therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin(R) domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape.\n\nHere, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that the multispecific DARPin(R) therapeutic design incorporated in our clinical candidate ensovibep (MP0420), achieved high neutralization potencies against the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant), B.1.351 (South African variant), P.1 (Brazilian variant), B.1.429 (South Californian variant), B.1.526 (New York variant), R.1 (Japanese variant), A.23.1 (Ugandan variant), and B.1.617 (Indian variant), and there is strong evidence that ensovibep also potently neutralizes the Indian variant B.1.618 based on the analysis of the key point mutations in the spike protein of this variant. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multispecific DARPin(R) antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin(R) molecules, suggest that ensovibep is a highly valuable alternative to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin(R) platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.', 'date': '2021-02-03', 'journal': ''}

The B.1.1.7 isolate identified in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 isolate identified in the Republic of South Africa encode spike proteins with multiple mutations in the S1 and S2 subunits. In addition, variants have been identified in Columbus, Ohio (COH.20G/677H), Europe (20A.EU2) and in domesticated minks. Analysis by antibody neutralization of pseudotyped viruses showed that convalescent sera from patients infected prior to the emergence of the variant viruses neutralized viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, COH.20G/677H Columbus Ohio, 20A.EU2 Europe and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor decrease in titer compared to that of the earlier D614G spike protein. Serum specimens from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine neutralized D614G virus with titers that were on average 7-fold greater than convalescent sera. Vaccine elicited antibodies neutralized virus with the B.1.1.7 spike protein with titers similar to D614G virus and neutralized virus with the B.1.351 spike with, on average, a 3-fold reduction in titer (1:500), a titer that was still higher than the average titer with which convalescent sera neutralized D614G (1:139). The reduction in titer was attributable to the E484K mutation in the RBD. The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses were not more infectious than D614G on ACE2.293T cells in vitro but N501Y, an ACE2 contacting residue present in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and COH.20G/677H spike proteins caused higher affinity binding to ACE2, likely contributing to their increased transmissibility. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by primary infection and by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are likely to maintain protective efficacy against B.1.1.7 and most other variants but that the partial resistance of virus with the B.1.351 spike protein could render some individuals less well protected, supporting a rationale for the development of modified vaccines containing E484K.', 'date': '2021-02-07', 'journal': ''}

Especially, the variant B.1.351 in South Africa with the hallmark of triple mutations (N501Y, K417N and E484K) is worrisome. Quickly after the outbreak of this new variant, several studies showed that both N501Y and E484K can enhance the binding between RBD and the human ACE2 receptor. However, the mutation K417N seems to be unfavorable because it removes one interfacial salt-bridge. So far, it is still not well understood why the K417N mutation is selected in the viral evolution. Here, we show that despite the loss in the binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2 the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt-bridge between RBD and the neutralizing antibody CB6 and thus substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, facilitating the variants to efficiently elude CB6 (as well as many other antibodies). Thus, when proliferating from person to person the virus might have adapted to the human immune system through evasive mutations. Taking into account limited and relevant experimental works in the field, we show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental findings. By harnessing the revealed molecular mechanism for variants, it becomes feasible to redesign therapeutic antibodies accordingly to make them more efficacious.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC="FIGDIR/small/430088v1_ufig1.gif" ALT="Figure 1">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce030eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a9f85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f1265org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140c0be_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG', 'date': '2021-02-07', 'journal': ''}

Here, we performed an integrated analysis, characterizing the nature, breadth and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in PLWH, controlled on ART, and HIV negative subjects. Both groups were in the convalescent phase of predominately mild COVID-19 disease. The majority of PLWH mounted SARS-CoV-2 Spike- and Nucleoprotein-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, as measured by ELISpot, at levels comparable to HIV negative subjects. T cell responses against Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid were the most prominent, with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells outnumbering CD8 T cells. Notably, the overall magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses related to the size of the naive CD4 T cell pool and the CD4:CD8 ratio in PLWH, in whom disparate antibody and T cell responses were observed. Both humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected at 5-7 months post-infection, providing evidence of medium-term durability of responses irrespective of HIV serostatus. Incomplete immune reconstitution on ART and a low CD4:CD8 ratio could, however, hamper the development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and serve as a useful tool for risk stratification of PLWH.

The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody drugs design.', 'date': '2021-02-17', 'journal': ''}

A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively).

The REGN10933 and REGN10987 combination was 9.1-fold less potent on B.1.351 and 16.2-fold less potent on mink cluster 5, raising concerns of reduced efficacy in the treatment of patients infected with variant viruses. The results suggest that there is a need to develop additional monoclonal antibodies that are not affected by the current spike protein mutations.', 'date': '2021-02-19', 'journal': ''}

Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising activity of the spike protein.', 'date': '2021-02-22', 'journal': ''}

A.', 'abstract': 'Tracking evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within infected individuals will help elucidate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and inform use of antiviral interventions. In this study, we developed an approach for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation that becomes detectable in vivo with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.\n\nAuthor SummaryMutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19. Importantly, concurrent analysis of paired serum samples in selected individuals revealed relatively low levels of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the time of initial sequencing. With increased serum binding to spike protein, we detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing independent mutations in a single epitope, as well as a transient increase in virus burden. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication creates sufficient virus genetic diversity to allow immune-mediated selection of variants within the time frame of acute COVID-19. Large-scale studies of SARS-CoV-2 variation and specific immune responses will help define the contributions of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution to COVID-19 clinical outcomes and antiviral drug susceptibility.', 'date': '2021-02-22', 'journal': ''}

D.; Greene, D.; Samadpour, M.; Sokurenko, E. V.', 'abstract': 'The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently.\n\nThe newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.', 'date': '2021-02-22', 'journal': ''}

The spike (S) protein, and particularly its receptor binding domain (RBD), mediates the interaction with the ACE2 receptor on host cells and may be modulated by its structural features. Therefore, well characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional posttranslational modifications) a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, higher level of sialylation and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, from both putative O-glycosylation sites, we could confirm that O-glycosylation was exclusively present at T323, which was previously unknown. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results.

Multiple vaccines have been deployed to date, but the continual evolution of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) has recently challenged their efficacy. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 variants originating in the U.K. (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and New York (B.1.526) have reduced neutralization activity from convalescent sera and compromised the efficacy of antibody cocktails that received emergency use authorization. Whereas vaccines can be updated periodically to account for emerging variants, complementary strategies are urgently needed to avert viral escape. One potential alternative is the use of camelid VHHs (also known as nanobodies), which due to their small size can recognize protein crevices that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and "nanomice" we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and camels. Through binding assays and cryo-electron microscopy, we identified two sets of highly neutralizing nanobodies. The first group expresses VHHs that circumvent RBD antigenic drift by recognizing a region outside the ACE2-binding site that is conserved in coronaviruses but is not typically targeted by monoclonal antibodies. The second group is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and fails to neutralize pseudoviruses carrying the E484K or N501Y substitutions. Notably however, they do neutralize the RBD variants when expressed as homotrimers, rivaling the most potent antibodies produced to date against SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2 binding domain, and recognition of conserved epitopes largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, while new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.', 'date': '2021-03-04', 'journal': ''}

Robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers to the 501Y.V2 variant were detected and these binding antibodies showed high levels of cross-reactivity for the original variant, from the first wave.

To determine the effects of somatic mutation on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, we analyzed six independent antibody lineages. As well as increased neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed pathways for acquisition of resistance and, in some cases, restricted the range of neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation apparently imposed a requirement for multiple spike mutations to enable escape. For certain antibody lineages, maturation enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD.

Here, we establish a protein engineering path for how a stable, long-acting drug candidate can be generated out of such a VHH building block. When fused to human IgG1-Fc, the prototype VHH72 molecule prophylactically protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we demonstrate that both systemic and intranasal application protects hACE-2-transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 induced lethal disease progression. To boost potency of the lead, we used structure-guided molecular modeling combined with rapid yeast-based Fc-fusion prototyping, resulting in the affinity-matured VHH72_S56A-Fc, with subnanomolar SARS-CoV-1 and -2 neutralizing potency. Upon humanization, VHH72_S56A was fused to a human IgG1 Fc with optimized manufacturing homogeneity and silenced effector functions for enhanced safety, and its stability as well as lack of off-target binding was extensively characterized. Therapeutic systemic administration of a low dose of VHH72_S56A-Fc antibodies strongly restricted replication of both original and D614G mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters, and minimized the development of lung damage. This work led to the selection of XVR011 for clinical development, a highly stable anti-COVID-19 biologic with excellent manufacturability.

Here, we constructed a panel of 28 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses bearing single or combined mutations found in the spike protein of these three variants, as well as additional nine mutations that within or close by the major antigenic sites in the spike protein identified in the GISAID database. These pseudoviruses were tested against a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including some approved for emergency use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, and convalescent patient plasma collected early in the pandemic. SA501Y.V2 pseudovirus was the most resistant, in magnitude and breadth, against mAbs and convalescent plasma, followed by BR501Y.V3, and then UK501Y.V1.

Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2  decoy that would trap the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2. We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass surrogate virus neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2 WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to predict affinity and inform therapeutic design. The ACE2 Triple Decoy is now undergoing continued assessment, including expression by a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) construct to facilitate delivery in vivo.\n\nSummary sentenceAn ACE2(N27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC fusion protein decoy sustains high affinity to all SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein variants tested, shows enhanced affinity for the N501Y and L452R variants, and the highest affinity for combined N501Y and E484K variants.', 'date': '2021-03-09', 'journal': ''}

As more drugs are being vetted, passive immunotherapy in the form of neutralizing antibodies can provide immediate action to combat the increasing numbers of COVID-positive cases. Herein, we demonstrate that equines hyper-immunized with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 generate high titers of antibody with a strong virus neutralizing potential. ELISA performed with pooled antisera displayed highest immunoglobulin titer on 42 days post-immunization, at 1:51,200 dilutions.

In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1-2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion.

Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages.\n\nMethodsIn this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the populations coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages.\n\nResultsWe observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P.2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P.1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage. Moreover, mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid T205I were predicted to have an overall higher affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populationals coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.2, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses.

Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2.

While the decision by some public health authorities to space the doses because of limiting supply has raised concerns about vaccine efficacy, data indicate that a single dose is up to 90% effective starting 14 days after its administration. We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of this mRNA vaccine. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine at this time point, no neutralizing activity were elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. However, we detected strong anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and Spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular responses dominated by the CD4+ T cell component. A single dose of this mRNA vaccine to individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 boosted all humoral and T cell responses measured, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Neutralizing responses were increased in both potency and breadth, with distinctive capacity to neutralize emerging variant strains. Our results highlight the importance of vaccinating uninfected and previously-infected individuals and shed new light into the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy.

The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions.

In the pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 ([&le;]2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP.

We tested the efficacy of a spike encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against the ancestral strain BavPat1 and the novel VOC B.1.351 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model.

VOC B.1.351-infected control animals experienced a delayed course of disease, yet nearly all SARS-CoV-2 challenged naive mice succumbed with virus dissemination and high viral loads. CVnCoV vaccine completely protected the animals from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in oral swabs, lung, or brain in these groups.

H.; Twaddle, A.; Marchand, B.; Gunsalus, K.', 'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y.

Of note, when the titers of the antibodies dropped to a sufficiently low level, only one boost quickly activated the anamnestic immune response, resulting in complete protection against the SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques without typical histopathological changes or viral replication in the lungs and other respiratory tissues. Our results indicated that immunization with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-trimer could raise long-term and broad immunity protection in nonhuman primates, thereby offering an optimal vaccination strategy against COVID-19.', 'date': '2021-03-30', 'journal': ''}

We assayed [~]200 variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes for their expression, ACE2 binding, and recognition by thirteen neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). An alanine scan of all five N-terminal domain (NTD) loops highlights a public class of epitopes in the N1, N3, and N5 loops that are recognized by most of the NTD-binding nAbs. Some clinical NTD substitutions abrogate binding to these epitopes but are circulating at low frequencies around the globe. NTD mutations in variants of concern B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.351 (South Africa), B.1.1.248 (Brazil), and B.1.427/B.1.429 (California) impact spike expression and escape most NTD-targeting nAbs. However, two classes of NTD nAbs still bind B.1.1.7 spikes and neutralize in pseudoviral assays. B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 include compensatory mutations that either increase spike expression or increase ACE2 binding affinity.

Consequently, the re-assessment of mAbs, previously reported to neutralize the original early-version of the virus, is of high priority.\n\nFour previously selected mAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes, were evaluated for their binding potency to RBD versions harboring individual mutations at spike positions 417, 439, 453, 477, 484 and 501. Mutations at these positions represent the prevailing worldwide distributed modifications of the RBD, previously reported to mediate escape from antibody neutralization. Additionally, the in vitro neutralization potencies of the four RBD-specific mAbs, as well as two NTD-specific mAbs, were evaluated against two frequent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs): (i) the B.1.1.7 variant, emerged in the UK and (ii) the B.1.351 variant, emerged in South Africa. Variant B.1.351 was previously suggested to escape many therapeutic mAbs, including those authorized for clinical use.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, we found that clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum were unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here we show that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising CpG/Alum adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel elicited potent anti-RBD and anti-spike antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did not.

The three most potent antibodies targeted distinct regions of the RBD, and all three neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. The crystal structure of the most potent antibody, CV503, revealed that it binds to the ridge region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, competes with the ACE2 receptor, and has limited contact with key variant residues K417, E484 and N501. We designed bispecific antibodies by combining non-overlapping specificities and identified five ultrapotent bispecific antibodies that inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at concentrations of <1 ng/mL. Through a novel mode of action three bispecific antibodies cross-linked adjacent spike proteins using dual NTD/RBD specificities. One bispecific antibody was >100-fold more potent than a cocktail of its parent monoclonals in vitro and prevented clinical disease in a hamster model at a 2.5 mg/kg dose. Notably, six of nine bispecific antibodies neutralized B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and the wild-type virus with comparable potency, despite partial or complete loss of activity of at least one parent monoclonal antibody against B.1.351. Furthermore, a bispecific antibody that neutralized B.1.351 protected against SARS-CoV-2 expressing the crucial E484K mutation in the hamster model.

The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to enrich the Golgi-resident fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on soluble and virion S trimers, is predominantly modified in the Golgi by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions.', 'date': '2021-04-01', 'journal': ''}

Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomain subunits with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titer at two weeks post immunization, which is significantly higher than titer induced by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented at two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results show that vaccination protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage (lung and nares) for protected animals, compared with ~10% weight loss, higher viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data show that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37{degrees}C for at least 4 weeks. These findings, along with a long history of safety for protein vaccines, suggest that the REVC-128 is a safe, stable and efficacious single-shot vaccine candidate to induce the earliest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'date': '2021-04-02', 'journal': ''}

Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8-10 weeks of age) were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developing more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovering more slowly than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage. Virus titers in respiratory tissues, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, and pulmonary cytokine concentrations, including IFN{beta} and TNF, were comparable between the sexes. However, during the recovery phase of infection, females mounted two-fold greater IgM, IgG, and IgA responses against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (S-RBD) in both plasma and respiratory tissues.

XAV-19 is a swine glyco-humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibody raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. XAV-19 target epitopes were found distributed all over the RBD and particularly cover the receptor binding motives (RBM), in direct contact sites with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Therefore, in Spike/ACE2 interaction assays, XAV-19 showed potent neutralization capacities of the original Wuhan Spike and of the United Kingdom (Alpha/B.1.1.7) and South African (Beta/B.1.351) variants. These results were confirmed by cytopathogenic assays using Vero E6 and live virus variants including the Brazil (Gamma/P.1) and the Indian (Delta/B.1.617.2) variants. In a selective pressure study with the Beta strain on Vero E6 cells conducted over 1 month, no mutation was associated with addition of increasing doses XAV-19. The potential to reduce viral load in lungs was confirmed in a human ACE2 transduced mouse model. XAV-19 is currently evaluated in patients hospitalized for COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia in a phase 2a-2b (NCT04453384) where safety was already demonstrated and in an ongoing 2/3 trial (NCT04928430) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XAV-19 in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Owing to its polyclonal nature and its glyco-humanization, XAV-19 may provide a novel safe and effective therapeutic tool to mitigate the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) including the different variants of concern identified so far.', 'date': '2021-04-05', 'journal': ''}

L.', 'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely worldwide. However, as soon as the vaccines were released - the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far - a few mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged raising doubts about their efficiency. Therefore, this work aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state (the one in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor ACE2) than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, once the increased observed in the free energy values is small. Conversely, the South African variant (B.1.351), when compared with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, is much more stable in the opened state (either with one or two RBDs in the up position) than in the closed state (with the three RBDs in the down position). Such results contribute to the understanding of the natural history of disease and also to indicate possible strategies to both develop new therapeutic molecules and to adjust the vaccine doses for a higher production of B cells antibodies.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY', 'date': '2021-04-06', 'journal': ''}

Here, we comprehensively characterize escape, breadth, and potency across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD), including S3094, the parental antibody of the late-stage clinical antibody VIR-7831. We observe a tradeoff between SARS-CoV-2 in vitro neutralization potency and breadth of binding across SARS-related coronaviruses. Nevertheless, we identify several neutralizing antibodies with exceptional breadth and resistance to escape, including a new antibody (S2H97) that binds with high affinity to all SARS-related coronavirus clades via a unique RBD epitope centered on residue E516. S2H97 and other escape-resistant antibodies have high binding affinity and target functionally constrained RBD residues. We find that antibodies targeting the ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM) typically have poor breadth and are readily escaped by mutations despite high neutralization potency, but we identify one potent RBM antibody (S2E12) with breadth across sarbecoviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and with a high barrier to viral escape.

Here, we showed nasal delivery of a new, unmodified camelid single-domain antibody (VHH), termed K-874A, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 titers in infected lungs of Syrian hamsters without causing weight loss and cytokine induction. In vitro studies demonstrated that K-874A neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in both VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and human lung-derived alveolar organoid cells. Unlike other drug candidates, K-874A blocks viral membrane fusion rather than viral attachment. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed K-874A bound between the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain of the virus S protein. Further, infected cells treated with K-874A produced fewer virus progeny that were less infective. We propose that direct administration of K-874A to the lung via a nebulizer could be a new treatment for preventing the reinfection of amplified virus in COVID-19 patients.\n\nAuthor summaryVaccines for COVID-19 are now available but therapeutic drugs are still needed to treat life-threatening cases and those who cannot be vaccinated. We discovered a new heavy-chain single-domain antibody that can effectively neutralize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19. Unlike other drug candidates, which prevent the virus from attaching to the receptor on the host cell, this new antibody acts by blocking the virus membrane from fusing with the host cell membrane. We studied the behavior of the new antibody in vitro using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and human lung organoids. When delivered through the nose to infected Syrian hamsters, we found that this antibody could prevent the typical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our results are significant because delivering simple drugs directly to infected lungs using a nebulizer could increase the potency of the drugs while reducing the risk of immune reaction that could occur if the drugs escape or are delivered through the blood stream.', 'date': '2021-04-09', 'journal': ''}

This is because the molecular mechanisms by which phenotypic changes in transmissibility or mortality remain unknown. Through molecular dynamics simulations with the NAMD 3 algorithm in the 50ns interval, it was possible to understand the impact on structural stabilization on the interaction of the ACE2-RBD complex, as well as simulations in 30ns for the neutralizing antibody P2B-2F6, with this antibody was derived from immune cells from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although not all molecular dynamics analyzes support the hypothesis of greater stability in the face of mutations, there was a predominance of low fluctuations. Thus, 3 (three) analyzes corroborate the hypothesis of greater ACE2-RBD stability as a result of P.1, among them: Low mean RMSF values, greater formation of hydrogen bonds and low solvent exposure measured by the SASA value. An inverse behavior occurs in the interaction with neutralizing antibodies, since the mutations induce greater instability and thus hinder the recognition of antibodies in neutralizing the Spike protein, where we noticed a smaller number of hydrogen bonds as a result of P.1. Through MM-PBSA energy decomposition, we found that Van der Waals interactions predominated and were more favorable when the structure has P.1 strain mutations. Therefore, we believe that greater stabilization of the ACE2-RBD complex may be a plausible explanation for why some mutations are converging in different strains, such as E484K and N501Y. The P.1 concern variant still makes the Spike protein recognizable by antibodies, and therefore, even if the vaccines efficacy can be diminished, there are no results in the literature that nullify them.', 'date': '2021-04-10', 'journal': ''}

Our model reproduces well the available experimental, epidemiological and clinical data on the impact of variants on the biophysical characteristics of the virus.

It is well-established in the literature that sequence-based clonal clustering can identify antibodies with similar epitope complementarity. However, there is growing evidence that antibodies from markedly different lineages but with similar structures can engage the same epitope with near-identical binding modes. Here, we describe a novel computational method for epitope profiling based on structural modelling and clustering, and show how it can identify sequence-dissimilar antibodies that engage the same epitope. We start by searching for evidence of structural conservation across the latest solved SARS-CoV-2--binding antibody crystal structures. Despite the relatively small number of solved structures, we find numerous examples of sequence-diverse but structurally-similar coronavirus-binding antibodies engaging the same epitope. We therefore developed a high-throughput structural modeling and clustering method to identify functionally-similar antibodies across the set of thousands of coronavirus-binding antibody sequences in the Coronavirus Antibody Database (CoV-AbDab). In the resulting multiple-occupancy structural clusters, 92% bind to consistent domains based on CoV-AbDab metadata. Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than would be suggested by sequence-based approaches.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme type-II (ACE2) to initiate viral attachment and ultimately viral pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that block RBD - ACE2 interactions. In this report, NAb-RBD binding epitopes in the protein databank were classified as C1, C1D, C2, C3, or C4, using a RBD binding profile (BP), based on NAb-specific RBD buried surface area and used to predict the binding epitopes of a series of uncharacterized NAbs. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence variation was also quantified to predict NAb binding sensitivities to the RBD-variants. NAb and ACE2 binding studies confirmed the NAb classifications and determined whether the RBD variants enhanced ACE2 binding to promote viral infectivity, and/or disrupted NAb binding to evade the host immune response. Of 9 single RBD mutants evaluated, K417T, E484K, and N501Y disrupted binding of 65% of the NAbs evaluated, consistent with the assignment of the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 Japan/Brazil strain as a variant of concern (VoC). RBD variants E484K and N501Y exhibited ACE2 binding equivalent to a Wuhan-1 reference SARS-CoV-2 RBD. While slightly less disruptive to NAb binding, L452R enhanced ACE2 binding affinity. Thus, the L452R mutant, associated with the SARS-CoV-2 California VoC (B.1.427/B.1.429-California), has evolved to enhance ACE2 binding, while simultaneously disrupting C1 and C2 NAb classes.

H.; Baldwin, A.; Davis, B. G.', 'abstract': 'Many host pathogen interactions such as human viruses (including non-SARS-coronaviruses) rely on attachment to host cell-surface glycans. There are conflicting reports about whether the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to sialic acid commonly found on host cell-surface N-linked glycans. In the absence of a biochemical assay, the ability to analyze the binding of glycans to heavily- modified proteins and resolve this issue is limited. Classical Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR can be confounded by overlapping sugar resonances that compound with known experimental constraints. Here we present  universal saturation transfer analysis (uSTA), an NMR method that builds on existing approaches to provide a general and automated workflow for studying protein-ligand interactions. uSTA reveals that B-origin-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer binds sialoside sugars in an  end on manner and modelling guided by uSTA localises binding to the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). The sialylated-polylactosamine motif is found on tetraantennary human N-linked-glycoproteins in deeper lung and may have played a role in zoonosis. Provocatively, sialic acid binding is abolished by mutations in some subsequent SARS- CoV-2 variants-of-concern. A very high resolution cryo-EM structure confirms the NTD location and  end on mode; it rationalises the effect of NTD mutations and the structure-activity relationship of sialic acid analogues. uSTA is demonstrated to be a robust, rapid and quantitative tool for analysis of binding, even in the most demanding systems.\n\nExtended AbstractThe surface proteins found on both pathogens and host cells mediate entry (and exit) and influence disease progression and transmission. Both types can bear host-generated post- translational modifications such as glycosylation that are essential for function but can confound biophysical methods used for dissecting key interactions. Several human viruses (including non- SARS-coronaviruses) attach to host cell-surface N-linked glycans that include forms of sialic acid (sialosides). There remains, however, conflicting evidence as to if or how SARS-associated coronaviruses might use such a mechanism. Here, we demonstrate quantitative extension of  saturation transfer protein NMR methods to a complete mathematical model of the magnetization transfer caused by interactions between protein and ligand. The method couples objective resonance-identification via a deconvolution algorithm with Bloch-McConnell analysis to enable a structural, kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of ligand binding beyond previously-perceived limits of exchange rates, concentration or system. Using an automated and openly available workflow this  universal saturation transfer analysis (uSTA) can be readily-applied in a range of even heavily-modified systems in a general manner to now obtain quantitative binding interaction parameters (KD, kEx). uSTA proved critical in mapping direct interactions between natural sialoside sugar ligands and relevant virus-surface attachment glycoproteins - SARS-CoV-2-spike and influenza-H1N1-haemagglutinin variants - by quantitating ligand signal in spectral regions otherwise occluded by resonances from mobile protein glycans (that also include sialosides). In B- origin-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer  end on-binding to sialoside sugars was revealed contrasting with  extended surface-binding for heparin sugar ligands; uSTA-derived constraints used in structural modelling suggested sialoside-glycan binding sites in a beta-sheet-rich region of spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Consistent with this, uSTA-glycan binding was minimally- perturbed by antibodies that neutralize the ACE2-binding domain (RBD) but strongly disrupted in spike from the B1.1.7/alpha and B1.351/beta variants-of-concern, which possess hotspot mutations in the NTD. Sialoside binding in B-origin-lineage-NTD was unequivocally pinpointed by cryo-EM to a site that is created from residues that are notably deleted in variants (e.g. H69,V70,Y145 in alpha). An analysis of beneficial genetic variances in cohorts of patients from early 2020 suggests a model in which this site in the NTD of B-origin-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 (but not in alpha/beta-variants) may have exploited a specific sialylated-polylactosamine motif found on tetraantennary human N-linked-glycoproteins in deeper lung. Together these confirm a novel binding mode mediated by the unusual NTD of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest how it may drive virulence and/or zoonosis via modulation of glycan attachment. Since cell-surface glycans are widely relevant to biology and pathology, uSTA can now provide ready, quantitative, widespread analysis of complex, host-derived and post-translationally modified proteins with putative ligands relevant to disease even in previously confounding complex systems.', 'date': '2021-04-14', 'journal': ''}

Conformational dynamics analysis revealed that binding-induced modulation of soft modes can elicit the unique protein response to different classes of antibodies. Mutational scanning heatmaps and sensitivity analysis revealed the binding energy hotspots for different classes of antibodies that are consistent with the experimental deep mutagenesis, showing that differences in the binding affinity caused by global circulating variants in spike positions K417, E484 and N501 are relatively moderate and may not fully account for the observed antibody resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and perturbation-response scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in the unbound form and antibody-bound forms, we examine how antibody binding can modulate allosteric propensities of spike protein residues and determine allosteric hotspots that control signal transmission and global conformational changes. These results show that residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating mutations correspond to a group of versatile allosteric centers in which small perturbations can modulate collective motions, alter the global allosteric response and elicit binding resistance.

Currently, as dangerous mutations emerge there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The spike glycoprotein on the virus membrane binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells through its receptor binding domain (RBD) to mediate virus entry. Thus, blocking this interaction may inhibit viral entry and consequently stop infection. Here, we generated fusion proteins composed of the extracellular portions of ACE2 and RBD fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (ACE2-Ig and RBD-Ig, respectively). We demonstrate that ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active and that it can be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection, better than ACE2-Ig. Mechanistically we show that anti-spike antibodies generation, ACE2 enzymatic activity and ACE2 surface expression were not affected by RBD-Ig.

As dangerous mutations emerge, there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection starts via binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to its receptor, ACE2, on host cells. To intercept this binding, we generated Ig-fusion proteins. ACE2-Ig was generated to possibly block RBD by binding to it and RBD-Ig to block ACE2. We indeed showed that the fusion proteins bind to their respective target. We found that it is more efficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking ACE2 receptor with RBD-Ig. We also showed that RBD-Ig does not interfere with ACE2 activity or surface expression.

Although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations at a slower rate compared with other RNA viruses, evolutionary pressures derived from the widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population have progressively favored the global emergence, though natural selection, of several variants of concern that carry multiple non-synonymous mutations in the spike glycoprotein. These are often placed in key sites within major antibody epitopes and may therefore confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, or otherwise compensate infectivity deficits associated with other non-synonymous substitutions. As previously shown by other authors, several emerging variants carry recurrent deletion regions (RDRs) that display a partial overlap with antibody epitopes located in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Comparatively, very little attention has been directed towards spike insertion mutations. This manuscript describes a single recurrent insertion region (RIR1) in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, characterized by at least 25 independent acquisitions of 2-8 additional codons between Arg214 and Asp215 in different viral lineages. Even though RIR1 is unlikely to confer antibody escape, its association with two distinct formerly widespread lineages (A.2.5 and B.1.214.2) and with known VOCs and VOIs warrants further investigation concerning its effects on spike structure and viral infectivity.', 'date': '2021-04-19', 'journal': ''}

H.', 'abstract': 'The fine-tuned control of immune responses is attained by pairs of activating and inhibitory signaling receptors which modulate the quality and magnitude of immune responses. Some viruses exploit these pathways to enter host cells as well as interfere with immune responses. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-1/2 Spike proteins (S) contain a potential inhibitory tyrosine- based immunoreceptor motif (ITIM) with the D614G variant occurring within this motif. Through an in silico screen of ITIM-containing human proteins, we find that the S-located ITIM is closely related to a previously reported ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail of the human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR), a pneumonia protective IL-6 family cytokine receptor. To infer potential functional interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection and LIFR expression, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of public datasets of lung tissues from healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. We show that transcripts of LIFR and its ligand LIF are highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible lung cells from mild and severe COVID-19 patients but not in healthy individuals. In addition, the human endogenous retroviral envelope gene (ERVW-1) encoding a fusogenic protein of the same functional class as the S protein, is induced in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell subpopulations in COVID-19 patients with no detectable expression in healthy individuals. We also report that pulmonary epithelial cells express transcripts of several immunoreceptors including the ITIM-containing antibody receptor FCGR2B which is detectable in healthy and severe COVID-19 cases but not in mild cases. These results suggest that molecular dysregulation of ITIM-mediated inhibitory signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may play a role in COVID-19 immunopathology.', 'date': '2021-04-19', 'journal': ''}

It was not known whether ACE2 is expressed on taste receptor cells (TRCs) nor if TRCs are infected directly. Using an in-situ hybridization (ISH) probe and an antibody specific to ACE2, it seems evident that ACE2 is present on a subpopulation of specialized TRCs, namely, PLC{beta}2 positive, Type II cells in taste buds in taste papillae. Fungiform papillae (FP) of a SARS-CoV-2+ patient exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including taste changes, were biopsied. Based on ISH, replicating SARS-CoV-2 was present in Type II cells of this patient. Therefore, taste Type II cells provide a portal for viral entry that predicts vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity. The continuity and cell turnover of the FP taste stem cell layer of the patient were disrupted during infection and had not fully recovered 6 weeks post symptom onset. Another patient suffering post-COVID-19 taste disturbances also had disrupted stem cells.

Here, we identified an extended network of pairwise interactions between RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations of the nanobody-RBD-ACE2 complex revealed that H11-H4 more strongly binds to RBD without overlapping with ACE2 and triggers dissociation of ACE2 due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 binding results in dissociation of ACE2 from RBD due to an overlap with the ACE2 binding site, whereas H11-D4 binding does not trigger ACE2 dissociation.

In this work we designed an RBD multimer construct with the purpose of increasing RBD immunogenicity. We produced multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between the RBD expressed in P. pastoris and Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very stable decameric protein of 170 kDa. We vaccinated mice with two doses 30 days apart, and then we measured humoral immune response. When the number of RBD copies coupled to BLS was high (6-7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer, in average), the immune response was significantly better than that elicited by RBD alone or even by RBD-BLS comprising low number of RBD copies (1-2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, the construct with high number of RBD copies induced high IgG titers with high neutralizing capacity. Furthermore, a superior immune response was observed when Al(OH)3 adjuvant was added to this formulation, exhibiting a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies. Altogether our results suggest that RBD covalent coupled to BLS forming a multimer-particle shows an advantageous architecture to the antigen-presentation to the immune system which enhances immune responses.

So far, analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on point nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast, insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the spike protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence and other inserts might have contributed to coronavirus pathogenicity as well. Here, we investigate insertions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identify 347 unique inserts of different lengths. We present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing errors. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. We show that inserts in the Spike glycoprotein can affect its antigenic properties and thus merit monitoring. At least, three inserts in the N-terminal domain of the Spike (ins245IME, ins246DSWG, and ins248SSLT) that were first detected in 2021 are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies, whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity.', 'date': '2021-04-26', 'journal': ''}

One of the variants, designated B.1.351, has shown a higher transmissibility due to greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor and decreased neutralization by convalescent plasma, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and post-vaccination plasma. Common to several of the variants is the N501Y mutation in the RBD, which may be responsible for at least part of the observed variant properties. To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of the Y501 RBD to inhibit binding of the wild type RBD and full SP (S1 + S2) to the ACE-2 protein and a human monoclonal IgG antibody elicited to the wild type RBD, relative to the wild type RBD in two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We found no significant difference in the IC50 of the two RBD species inhibition of ACE-2 binding, but unexpectedly found that the IC50 of the wild type RBD inhibition of antibody binding was nearly twice that of the Y501 RBD, reflecting a lower affinity. These results suggest that the individual N501Y mutation does not contribute to altered viral properties by itself, but may contribute to a collective conformational shift produced by multiple mutations.', 'date': '2021-04-27', 'journal': ''}

They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats. In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by about 8{degrees}C to 10{degrees}C when the original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr, as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol. In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C. Thus, the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (>90{degrees}C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug. Overall, such N-terminal capping repeats with increased thermostability seem to be beneficial for the development of innovative drugs based on DARPins.', 'date': '2021-04-27', 'journal': ''}

A.; Perez-Sala, D.', 'abstract': 'The Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 mediates docking of the virus onto cells and contributes to viral invasion. Several cellular receptors are involved in SARS-CoV-2 Spike docking at the cell surface, including ACE2 and neuropilin. The intermediate filament protein vimentin has been reported to be present at the surface of certain cells and act as a co-receptor for several viruses; furthermore, its potential involvement in interactions with Spike proteins has been proposed. Here we have explored the binding of Spike protein constructs to several cell types using low-temperature immunofluorescence approaches in live cells, to minimize internalization. Incubation of cells with tagged Spike S or Spike S1 subunit led to discrete dotted patterns at the cell surface, which showed scarce colocalization with a lipid raft marker, but consistent coincidence with ACE2. Under our conditions, vimentin immunoreactivity appeared as spots or patches unevenly distributed at the surface of diverse cell types. Remarkably, several observations including potential antibody internalization and adherence to cells of vimentin-positive structures present in the extracellular medium exposed the complexity of vimentin cell surface immunoreactivity, which requires careful assessment. Notably, overall colocalization of Spike and vimentin signals markedly varied with the cell type and the immunodetection sequence. In turn, vimentin-positive spots moderately colocalized with ACE2; however, a particular enrichment was detected at elongated structures positive for acetylated tubulin, consistent with primary cilia, which also showed Spike binding. Thus, these results suggest that vimentin-ACE2 interaction could occur at selective locations near the cell surface, including ciliated structures, which can act as platforms for SARS-CoV-2 docking.', 'date': '2021-05-04', 'journal': ''}

The communal nature of these facilities, paired with the high-risk profile of residents, has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths and a high case fatality rate. To detect pre-symptomatic infections and identify infected workers, we performed weekly surveillance testing of staff at two LTCFs which revealed a large outbreak at one of the sites. We collected serum from staff members throughout the study and evaluated it for binding and neutralization to measure seroprevalence, seroconversion, and type and functionality of antibodies. At the site with very few incident infections, we detected that over 40% of the staff had preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting prior exposure. At the outbreak site, we saw rapid seroconversion following infection. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable for many weeks following infection, suggesting a durable, long-lived response. Receptor-binding domain antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated. The site with high seroprevalence among staff had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility through seronegative infected staff during the period of study but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Together our results reveal that high seroprevalence rate among staff can contribute to herd immunity within a workplace and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility.', 'date': '2021-05-05', 'journal': ''}

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although with moderate efficiency.

Influenza qNIV adjuvanted with Matrix-M was well-tolerated and induced robust antibody and cellular responses, notably against both homologous and drifted A/H3N2 viruses in Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials. We also developed a full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine which is stable in the prefusion conformation (NVX-CoV2373) using the same platform technology.

A.; Mazurov, D.', 'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed a global threat to human lives and economics. One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.\n\nImportanceImmune surveillance of viral or bacterial infections is largely mediated by neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are produced after vaccination or infection, but their titers only partly reflect the degree of protection against infection. To identify protective antibodies, a neutralization test with replicating viruses or pseudoviruses (PVs) is required. This study developed lentiviral-based PV neutralization assays that, unlike similar systems reported earlier, enable quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell cocultures. Using both PVs and replication-competent virus, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is considerably more resistant to serum neutralization than infection with purified viral particles. The tests are easy to set up in many labs, and are believed to be more informative for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 collective immunity or entry inhibitor screening.', 'date': '2021-05-05', 'journal': ''}

We investigated the viral load and pathogenic potential of B.1.617.1 in Syrian golden hamsters.\n\nMethodsTwo groups of Syrian golden hamsters (9 each) were inoculated intranasally with SARS CoV-2 isolates, B.1 (D614G) and B.1.617.1 respectively. The animals were monitored daily for the clinical signs and body weight. The necropsy of three hamsters each was performed on 3, 5- and 7-days post-infection (DPI).

Neutralizing nanobodies (VHH) represent a promising therapeutic intervention strategy to address the current SARS-2 pandemic and provide a powerful toolkit to address future virus outbreaks. Using a synthetic, high-diversity VHH bacteriophage library, several potent neutralizing VHH antibodies were identified and evaluated for their capacity to tightly bind to the SARS-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), to prevent binding of SARS-2 spike (S) to the cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and to neutralize viral infection. Preliminary preclinical evaluation of multiple nanobody candidates demonstrate that they are prophylactically and therapeutically effective in vivo against wildtype SARS-2. The identified and characterized nanobodies described herein represent viable candidates for further preclinical evaluation and another tool to add to our therapeutic arsenal to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAuthor SummaryTo fully address the on-going pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-2), it will be important to have both vaccines and therapeutic strategies to prevent and mitigate the effects of SARS-2. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of potently neutralizing humanized single domain heavy chain (VHH) antibodies that have binding affinity for both the original Wuhan strain and widely circulating B.1.1.7/UK strain. VHH antibodies have the same therapeutic potential as conventional antibodies in half the size and with greater stability and solubility. Using a synthetic humanized high-diversity VHH phage library we identified several candidates with strong affinity for the SARS-2 spike that block the interaction of SARS-2 spike with the cellular receptor ACE2, and effectively neutralize infection with SARS-2 in vitro. By sequencing viral escape mutants generated in the presence of each VHH we mapped the binding sites of the VHH antibodies and assessed their affinity against newly emerging SARS-2 variants. Finally, we demonstrate that two of these VHH antibodies show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo against challenge with SARS-2. This study establishes that screening highly diverse VHH phage libraries against viral threats can yield highly effective therapeutic agents in real time.', 'date': '2021-05-06', 'journal': ''}

Here we report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines3,4. In the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response, and as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern that are comparable to or greater than neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 achieved by vaccination of naive individuals2,5-8. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover, and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in variants of concern4,9. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand dramatically after vaccination.

Here we present a generalizable assay platform, nanobody-functionalized nanoparticles for rapid, electronic detection (Nano2RED), demonstrated in the detection of Ebola and COVID-19 antigens. To efficiently generate high-quality affinity reagents, synthetic nanobody co-binders and mono-binders with high affinity, specificity, and stability were selected by phage display screening of a vastly diverse, rationally randomized combinatorial library, bacterially expressed and site-specifically conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as multivalent in-solution sensors. Without requiring fluorescent labelling, washing, or enzymatic amplification, these AuNPs reliably transduce antigen binding signals upon mixing into physical AuNP aggregation and sedimentation processes, displaying antigen-dependent optical extinction readily detectable by spectrometry or simple electronic circuitry. With nanobodies against an Ebola virus secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as targets, Nano2RED showed a high sensitivity (limit of detection of [~]10 pg/mL for sGP and [~]40 pg/mL for RBD in diluted human serum), a high specificity, and a large dynamic range ([~]7 logs). Unlike conventional assays where slow mass transport for surface binding limits the assay time, Nano2RED features fast antigen diffusion at micrometer scale, and can be accelerated to deliver results within a few minutes. The rapid detection, low material cost (estimated < $0.01 per test), inexpensive and portable readout system (< $5 and < 100 cm3), and digital data output, make Nano2RED particularly suitable for screening of patient samples with simplified operation and accelerated data transmission.

There is evidence that some of these variants are less sensitive to neutralization in vitro, but it is not clear whether they can evade vaccine induced protection. In this study, we tested the utility of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a vaccine antigen and explore the effect of formulation with Alum/MPLA or AddaS03 adjuvants. Our results indicate RBD induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies and activates strong cellular immune responses. There is also significant cross-neutralisation of variants B1.1.7 and B.1.351 and to a lesser extent, SARS-CoV-1.

Binding to ACE2 requires an open RBD, and is believed to trigger the series of dramatic conformational changes in the spike that lead to the shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the spring-loaded S2 subunit to the experimentally observed post-fusion structure. The steps following ACE2 binding are poorly understood despite extensive characterization of the spike through X-ray, cryo-EM, and computation.

However, these reported models and their associated electrostatic potential maps represent an unknown admixture of conformations stemming from the underlying energy landscape of the spike protein. As for any protein, some of the spikes conformational motions are expected to be biophysically relevant, but cannot be interpreted only by static models. Using experimental cryo-EM images, we present the energy landscape of the spike protein conformations, and identify molecular rearrangements along the most-likely conformational path in the vicinity of the open (so called 1RBD-up) state. The resulting global and local atomic refinements reveal larger movements than those expected by comparing the reported 1RBD-up and 1RBD-down cryo-EM models. Here we report greater degrees of "openness" in global conformations of the 1RBD-up state, not revealed in the single-model interpretations of the density maps, together with conformations that overlap with the reported models. We discover how the glycan shield contributes to the stability of these conformations along the minimum free-energy pathway. A local analysis of seven key binding pockets reveals that six out them, including those for engaging ACE2, therapeutic mini-proteins, linoleic acid, two different kinds of antibodies, and protein-glycan interaction sites, switch conformations between their known apo- and holo-conformations, even when the global spike conformation is 1RBD-up.

Demonstrated in crystal structures, the residues 452 and 484 in RBD are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, the E484Q and L452R mutations might not significantly affect RBDs binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without the known molecular mechanism, these two successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) can be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using in silico all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation as well as deep learning (DL) approaches, here we show that these two mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between RBD and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab) that was proven to be efficacious for neutralizing the wide-type SARS-CoV-2.

CD147 antibody could effectively clear the virus and alveolar exudation, resolving the pneumonia. We found the elevated level of cyclophilin A (CyPA) in plasma of severe/critical cases, and identified CyPA as the most important proinflammatory intermediate causing cytokine storm. Mechanistically, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to CD147 and initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which induced expression of CyPA. CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147, triggered MAPK pathway and consequently mediated the expression of cytokine and chemokine.

Following emergency use authorisation, scale up in vaccine administration has inevitably revealed vaccine related adverse effects; too rare to observe even in large Phase-III clinical trials. These include vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), an ultra-rare adverse event in which patients develop life-threatening blood clots 5-24 days following vaccination.\n\nTo investigate vector-host interactions of ChAdOx1 underpinning VITT we solved the structure of the ChAdOx1 capsid by CryoEM, and the structure of the primary receptor tropism determining fiber-knob protein by crystallography. These structural insights have enabled us to unravel key protein interactions involved in ChAdOx1 cell entry and a possible means by which it may generate misplaced immunity to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein involved in coagulation.\n\nWe use in vitro cell binding assays to show that the fiber-knob protein uses coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) as a high affinity binding partner, while it does not form a stable interface with CD46. Computational simulations identified a putative mechanism by which the ChAdOx1 capsid interacts with PF4 by binding in the spaces between hexon proteins, with downstream implications for the causes of VITT.\n\nSummaryWe present the structure of the ChAdOx1 viral vector, derived from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 at 4.2[A] resolution1. ChAdOx1 is in global use in the AstraZeneca vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD-1222, to combat the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. Recently observed, rare, adverse events make detailed mechanistic understanding of this vector key to informing proper treatment of affected patients and the development of safer viral vectors.\n\nHere, we determine a primary mechanism ChAdOx1 uses to attach to cells is coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a protein which is identical in humans and chimpanzees. We demonstrate the vector does not form a stable CD46 interaction, a common species B adenovirus receptor, via its primary attachment protein.\n\nFurther, we reveal the surface of the ChAdOx1 viral capsid has a strong electronegative potential. Molecular simulations suggest this charge, together with shape complementarity, are a mechanism by which an oppositely charged protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4) may bind the vector surface. PF4 is a key protein involved in the formation of blood clots2, and the target of auto-antibodies in heparin-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (HITT)3, an adverse reaction to heparin therapy which presents similarly to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), a rare complication of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination4-6.

G.', 'abstract': 'The spike is the main protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface. The spike receptor binding motif mediates recognition of the hACE2 receptor, a critical infection step, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Post-translational modifications of the spike receptor binding motif can modulate viral infectivity and immune response. We studied the spike protein in search for asparagine deamidation, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, affecting both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Similar deamidation hotspots are frequently found at the spike receptor-binding motifs of related sarbecoviruses, at positions that are mutated in emerging variants and in escape mutants from neutralizing antibodies. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 from the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-time of 16.5 and 123 days at 37 {degrees}C, respectively. This process is significantly slowed down at 4 {degrees}C, pointing at a strong dependence of spike molecular aging on the environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the hACE2 receptor more than 3.5-fold. A model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrates that deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif leads to the accumulation in the virion surface of a chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a mechanism for molecular aging of the spike, with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development.', 'date': '2021-05-21', 'journal': ''}

A.; Hubbell, J. A.', 'abstract': 'The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an unprecedented global crisis, and curtailing its spread requires an effective vaccine which elicits a diverse and robust immune response. We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum, amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We conclude that Spike-p(Man-TLR7) is an attractive, next-generation subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing durable and robust antibody and T cell responses.', 'date': '2021-05-21', 'journal': ''}

A.', 'abstract': 'A previous report demonstrated the strong association between the presence of antibodies binding to an epitope region from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, termed Ep9, and COVID-19 disease severity. Patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies (Abs) had hallmarks of antigenic imprinting (AIM), including early IgG upregulation and cytokine-associated injury. Thus, the immunological memory of a previous infection was hypothesized to drive formation of suboptimal anti-Ep9 Abs in severe COVID-19 infections. This study identifies a putative primary antigen capable of stimulating production of cross-reactive, anti-Ep9 Abs. Binding assays with patient blood samples directly show cross-reactivity between Abs binding to Ep9 and only one bioinformatics-derived, homologous potential antigen, a sequence derived from the neuraminidase protein of H3N2 Influenza A virus. This cross-reactive binding is highly influenza strain specific and sensitive to even single amino acid changes in epitope sequence. The neuraminidase protein is not present in the influenza vaccine, and the anti-Ep9 Abs likely resulted from the widespread influenza infection in 2014. Therefore, AIM from a previous infection could underlie some cases of COVID-19 disease severity.\n\nImportanceInfections with SARS-COV-2 result in diverse disease outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. The mechanisms underlying different disease outcomes remain largely unexplained. Previously, our laboratory identified a strong association between the presence of an antibody and increased disease severity in a subset of COVID-19 patients. Here, we report that this severity-associated antibody cross-reacts with viral proteins from an influenza A viral strain from 2014. Therefore, we speculate that antibodies generated against previous infections, like the 2014 influenza A, play a significant role in directing some peoples immune responses against SARS-COV-2. Such understanding of the sources and drivers of COVID-19 disease severity can help early identification and pre-emptive treatment.', 'date': '2021-05-24', 'journal': ''}

Like SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 enters host cells via its spike protein, which attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS CoV-1 spike protein is reported to induce cytokine production, we hypothesized that this pathway could be a shared mechanism underlying pathogenic immune responses. We herein compared the capabilities of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins to induce cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We observed that only specific commercial lots of SARS CoV-2 induce cytokine production. Surprisingly, recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike proteins from different vendors and batches exhibited different patterns of cytokine induction, and these activities were not inhibited by blockade of spike protein-ACE2 binding using either soluble ACE2 or neutralizing anti-S1 antibody. Moreover, commercial spike protein reagents contained varying levels of endotoxin, which correlated directly with their abilities to induce cytokine production. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibitor, polymyxin B, blocked this cytokine induction activity. In addition, SARS CoV-2 spike protein avidly bound soluble LPS in vitro, rendering it a cytokine inducer. These results not only suggest caution in monitoring the purity of SARS CoV-2 spike protein reagents, but they indicate the possibility that interactions of SARS CoV-2 spike protein with LPS from commensal bacteria in virally infected mucosal tissues could promote pathogenic inflammatory cytokine production.', 'date': '2021-05-26', 'journal': ''}

Currently, a worldwide effort has been mounted to generate billions of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses to immunize the worlds population at record speeds. However, there is still demand for alternative effective vaccines that rapidly confer long-term protection and rely upon cost-effective, easily scaled-up manufacturing. Here, we present a Sindbis alphavirus vector (SV), transiently expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SV.Spike), combined with the OX40 immunostimulatory antibody (OX40) as a novel, highly effective vaccine approach. We show that SV.Spike plus OX40 elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and a vigorous T-cell response in mice. Protein binding, immunohistochemical and cellular infection assays all show that vaccinated mice sera inhibits spike functions. Immunophenotyping, RNA Seq transcriptome profiles and metabolic analysis indicate a reprogramming of T-cells in vaccinated mice. Activated T-cells were found to mobilize to lung tissue. Most importantly, SV.Spike plus OX40 provided robust immune protection against infection with authentic coronavirus in transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2-Tg). Finally, our immunization strategy induced strong effector memory response, potentiating protective immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results show the potential of a new Sindbis virus-based vaccine platform to counteract waning immune response that can be used as a new candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2.

These variants are the B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.1.7 with the additional E484K mutation, the B.1.351 variant (South Africa) and the P.1 variant (Brazil). Understanding the binding modalities between these viral variants and the host cell receptor ACE2 allows depicting changes, but also common motifs of virus-host cell interaction. The trimeric spike protein expressed at the viral surface contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that forms the molecular interface with ACE2. All the above-mentioned variants carry between one and three amino acid exchanges within the interface-forming region of the RBD, thereby altering the binding interface with ACE2. Using molecular dynamics simulations and decomposition of the interaction energies between the RBD and ACE2, we identified phenylalanine 486, glutamine 498, threonine 500 and tyrosine 505 as important interface-forming residues across viral variants. We also suggest a reduced binding energy between RBD and ACE2 in viral variants with higher infectivity, attributed to residue-specific differences in electrostatic interaction energy. Importantly, individual amino acid exchanges not only influence the affected position, but also alter the conformation of surrounding residues and affect their interaction potential as well. We demonstrate how computational methods can help to identify changed as well as common motifs across viral variants. These identified motifs might play a crucial role, in the strategical development of therapeutic interventions against the fast mutating SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSignificance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has significantly changed our lives. To date, there is a lack of neutralizing drugs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2. Hope lies in newly developed vaccines that effectively prevent severe cases of acute respiratory syndrome. However, emerging viral variants escape vaccine-induced immune-protection. Therefore, identification of appropriate molecular targets across viral variants is important for the development of second- and third-generation vaccines and inhibitory antibodies. In this study, we identify residues across viral variants that are important for viral binding to the host cell. As such residues cannot be replaced without diminishing infectivity of the virus, these residues represent primary targets for intervention, for example by neutralizing antibodies.', 'date': '2021-05-28', 'journal': ''}

E.; Liu, S.-L.', 'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While ACE2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccine sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.', 'date': '2021-06-01', 'journal': ''}

Emergence of several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concern about potential immune escape. In this study, we performed an immunogenicity comparison of ancestral RBD, S1, and S ectodomain trimer (S-trimer) antigens and tested the efficacy of these prototype vaccines against the circulating variants, especially B.1.617 that has been linked to Indias current COVID-19 surge. We found that RBD and S-trimer proteins could induce significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than S1 protein. For the three vaccines, the neutralizing titers decreased over time, but still remained high for at least five months after immunization. Importantly, the three prototype vaccines were still effective in neutralizing the variants of concern, although B.1.351 and B.1.617.1 lineages showed varying degrees of reduction in neutralization by the immune sera. The vaccines-induced sera were shown to block receptor binding and inhibit S protein-mediated membrane fusion.

In the present study, we explored the genomic and structural basis of this variant through computational analysis, protein modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations approach.

This work aimed to develop an oral multi-antigen SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprised of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein, two domains of the viral nucleocapsid protein (N), and heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB), a potent mucosal adjuvant. The humoral, mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses of both a three-dose vaccination schedule and a heterologous subcutaneous prime and oral booster regimen were assessed in mice and rats, respectively.

Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150 and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent sera were reduced by 4-16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs modestly enhanced their neutralization potential.

We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co- immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.\n\nAuthor summaryAnti-Spike neutralizing antibodies provide strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models, and correlate with protection in humans, supporting the notion that induction of strong humoral immunity is key to protection. We show induction of robust antibody and T cell responses by different Spike DNA-based vaccine regimens able to effectively mediate protection and to control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus macaque model. This study provides the opportunity to compare vaccines able to induce different humoral and cellular immune responses in an effort to develop durable immunity against the SARS-CoV-2. A vaccine regimen comprising simultaneous co-immunization of DNA and Protein at the same anatomical site showed best neutralizing abilities and was more effective than DNA alone in inducing protective immune responses and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, an expansion of the DNA vaccine regimen to include co-immunization with Spike protein may be of advantage also for SARS-CoV-2.', 'date': '2021-06-11', 'journal': ''}

The vaccine elicits strong pro-inflammatory CD4 Th1 and CD8 T-cell responses to both proteins, with these responses being significantly enhanced by fusing the nucleocapsid sequence to a modified Fc domain. We have shown that the vaccine also stimulates high titre antibody responses to RBD which efficiently neutralise in both a pseudotype and live virus neutralisation assay and show cross reactivity with S proteins from the emerging variants Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351). This DNA platform can be easily adapted to target variant RBD and N proteins and we show that a vaccine variant encoding the B.1.351 RBD sequence stimulates cross-reactive humoral and T-cell immunity.

Here, guided by structural and computational analyses, we present a mutation-integrated trimeric form of RBD (mutI tri-RBD) as a broadly protective vaccine candidate, in which three RBDs were individually grafted from three different circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains including the prototype, Beta (B.1.351) and Kappa (B.1.617). The three RBDs were then connected end-to-end and co-assembled to possibly mimic the native trimeric arrangements in the natural S protein trimer. The recombinant expression of the mutI tri-RBD, as well as the homo-tri-RBD where the three RBDs were all truncated from the prototype strain, by mammalian cell exhibited correct folding, strong bio-activities, and high stability. The immunization of both the mutI tri-RBD and homo-tri-RBD plus aluminum adjuvant induced high levels of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain in mice. Notably, regarding to the "immune-escape" Beta (B.1.351) variant, mutI tri-RBD elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than homo-tri-RBD. Furthermore, due to harboring the immune-resistant mutations as well as the evolutionarily convergent hotspots, the designed mutI tri-RBD also induced strong broadly neutralizing activities against various SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the variants partially resistant to homo-tri-RBD. Homo-tri-RBD has been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration to enter clinical trial (No. NCT04869592), and the superior broad neutralization performances against SARS-CoV-2 support the mutI tri-RBD as a more promising vaccine candidate for further clinical developments.', 'date': '2021-06-18', 'journal': ''}

The purpose of this study is to assess IgG antibody responses following immunization with BNT162b2 (30 g S protein) and mRNA-1273 (100 g S protein) vaccines. A cohort of clinicians at a non-for-profit organization is being assessed clinically and serologically following immunization with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. IgG responses were measured at the Remington Laboratory by an IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-receptor binding domain. Mixed-effect linear (MEL) regression modeling was used to examine whether the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level differed by vaccine brand, dosage, or days since vaccination. Among 532 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants, 530 (99.6%) seroconverted with either vaccine. After adjustments for age and gender MEL regression modeling revealed that the average IgG increased after the second dose compared to the first dose (p<0.001). Overall, titers peaked at week six for both vaccines. Titers were significantly higher for mRNA-1273 vaccine on days 14-20 (p < 0.05), 42-48 (p < 0.01), 70-76 (p < 0.05), 77-83 (p < 0.05), and higher for BNT162b2 vaccine on days 28-34 (p < 0.001). In two participants taking immunosuppressive drugs SARS-CoV-2 IgG remained negative. mRNA-1273 elicited both earlier and higher IgG antibody responses than BNT162b2, possibly due to the higher S-protein delivery.

We simultaneously measured 10 different criteria and non-criteria aPL (IgM and IgG) by using a line immunoassay. Further, IgG antibody response against three SARS-CoV-2 proteins was investigated using tripartite automated blood immunoassay technology. Our analyses revealed that selected non-criteria aPL were enriched concomitant to or after an infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The gain in binding affinity for the N501Y RBD mutant to the ACE2 is attributed to improved {pi}-{pi} stacking and {pi}-cation interactions. The enhanced receptor affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of a specific hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interaction with Glu75 of ACE2. Notably, both the mutations reduce the binding affinity for B38 due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions.

The virus initiates the infection of susceptible cells by binding with its spike protein (S) to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here we applied the T cell receptor fusion construct (TRuC) technology to engineer T cells against such infected cells. In our TRuCs an S-binding domain is fused to the CD3{varepsilon} component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, enabling recognition of S-containing cells in an HLA independent manner. This domain either consists of the S-binding part of ACE2 or a single-chain variable fragment of an anti-S antibody. We show that the TRuC T cells are activated by and kill cells that express S of SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) variants at the cell surface. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with our engineered T cells did not lead to massive cytotoxicity towards the infected cells, but resulted in a complete rescue of the translational shutdown despite ongoing viral replication.

We examined the efficacy of administration of highly-neutralizing COVID-19-convalescent plasma (hn-plasmas) and such plasma-derived IgG administration using the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Two hn-plasmas, which were in the best 1% of 340 neutralizing-activity-determined convalescent plasma samples, were intraperitoneally administered to SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, resulting in significant reduction of viral titers in lungs by up to 32-fold as compared to the viral titers in hamsters receiving control non-neutralizing plasma, while with two moderately neutralizing plasmas (mn-plasmas) administered, viral titer reduction was by up to 6-fold. IgG fractions purified from the two hn-plasmas also reduced viral titers in lungs than those from the two mn-plasmas. The severity of lung lesions seen in hamsters receiving hn-plasmas was minimal to moderate as assessed using micro-computerized tomography, which histological examination confirmed. Western blotting revealed that all four COVID-19-convalescent-plasmas variably contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 components including the receptor-binding domain and S1 domain. The present data strongly suggest that administering potent-neutralizing-activity-confirmed COVID-19-convalescent plasmas would be efficacious in treating patients with COVID-19.\n\nImportanceConvalescent plasmas obtained from patients, who recovered from a specific infection, have been used as agents to treat other patients infected with the very pathogen. To treat using convalescent plasmas, despite that more than 10 randomized-controlled-clinical-trials have been conducted and more than 100 studies are currently ongoing, the effects of convalescent plasma against COVID-19 remained uncertain. On the other hand, certain COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to reduce the clinical COVID-19 onset by 94-95%, for which the elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are apparently directly responsible. Here, we demonstrate that highly-neutralizing-effect-confirmed convalescent plasmas significantly reduce the viral titers in the lung of SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters and block the development of virally-induced lung lesions. The present data provide a proof-of-concept that the presence of highly-neutralizing antibody in COVID-19-convalescent plasmas is directly responsible for the reduction of viral replication and support the use of highly-neutralizing antibody-containing plasmas in COVID-19 therapy with convalescent plasmas.', 'date': '2021-06-30', 'journal': ''}

In this study, the infectivity and susceptibility of viruses with the lambda variant spike protein to neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies was tested. Virus with the lambda spike had higher infectivity and was neutralized by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies with a relatively minor 2.3-3.3-fold decrease in titer on average.

Although the RBD peptide subunit is easily manufactured and highly stable, RBD-based subunit vaccines have been hampered by its poor inherent immunogenicity. We hypothesize that this limitation can be overcome by sustained co-administration alongside a potent and optimized adjuvant. The innate immune second messenger, cGAMP, holds promise as it activates the potent anti-viral STING pathway, but has exhibited poor performance as a therapeutic due to its nonspecific pharmacodynamic profiles when administered systemically and its poor pharmacokinetics arising from rapid excretion and degradation by its hydrolase ENPP1. To overcome these limitations, we sought to mimic the natural scenario of viral infections by creating an artificial immunological niche that enables slow release of cGAMP and the RBD antigen. Specifically, we co-encapsulated cGAMP and RBD in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system. This cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel vaccine elicited more potent, durable, and broad antibody responses and improved neutralization than both dose-matched bolus controls and a hydrogel-based vaccine lacking cGAMP.

J.; Martin-Galiano, A. J.', 'abstract': "The massive assessment of immune evasion due to viral mutations that potentially increase COVID-19 susceptibility can be computationally facilitated. The adaptive cytotoxic T response is critical during primary infection and the generation of long-term protection. Potential epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 HLA class I families. Allele families showed extreme differences in number of recognized epitopes, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Among them, the B27 supertype showed the lowest number of epitopes. Epitope escape mutations identified in ~118,000 NCBI isolates mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27, which reached up to 33%. In contrast to most supertypes, eight particular allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles. Collectively, these data indicate that independent escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. This study highlights the automated integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially affecting the population as a whole, as well as minority subpopulations.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe cytotoxic T response, a type of immune response dependent upon an individual's genetics that does not require antibodies, is critical for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential bypass of the cytotoxic T response by mutations acquired by the virus after one year of the pandemic is therefore of maximal concern. We have approached the complexity of human variability and more than 100.000 viral genomes in this respect using a computational strategy. We have detected numerous mutations in these genomes that mask some viral regions involved in the cytotoxic response. However, the accumulation of these changes in independent isolates is still too low to threaten the global human population. In contrast, our protocol has identified mutations that may be relevant for specific populations and minorities with cytotoxic genetic backgrounds susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some viral variants co-existed in the same country with these human communities which warrants deeper surveillance in these cases to prevent local outbreaks. Our study support the integration of massive data of different natures in the surveillance of viral pandemics.", 'date': '2021-07-05', 'journal': ''}

Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine (Covax-19). A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain (ECD) was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. The Advax-SM adjuvanted vaccine induced high titers of binding antibody against spike protein that were able to neutralise the original wildtype virus on which the vaccine was based as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. The Covax-19 vaccine also induced potent spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype, and this was shown to be associated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing of spike labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus 2 weeks after the second immunisation. Notably, ferrets that received two 25 or 50g doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge, suggesting the possibility that Covax-19 vaccine may in addition to protection against lung infection also have the potential to block virus transmission.

Here, we show that immunization of macaques with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein generates potent receptor binding domain cross- neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, in contrast to human infection or vaccination where responses are typically SARS-CoV-2-specific. Furthermore, the macaque nAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Structural studies show that different immunodominant sites are targeted by the two primate species. Human antibodies generally target epitopes strongly overlapping the ACE2 receptor binding site (RBS), whereas the macaque antibodies recognize a relatively conserved region proximal to the RBS that represents another potential pan-SARS-related virus site rarely targeted by human antibodies. B cell repertoire differences between the two primates appear to significantly influence the vaccine response and suggest care in the use of rhesus macaques in evaluation of vaccines to SARS-related viruses intended for human use.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYBroadly neutralizing antibodies to an unappreciated site of conservation in the RBD in SARS- related viruses can be readily induced in rhesus macaques because of distinct properties of the naive macaque B cell repertoire that suggest prudence in the use of the macaque model in SARS vaccine evaluation and design.', 'date': '2021-07-06', 'journal': ''}

Transcriptional profiling indicated significant induction of antiviral pathways in response to all three challenges with a more robust inflammatory signature in response to B.1.1.7. Furthermore, no additional mutations in the spike protein were detected at peak disease. In conclusion, the emerging VOC showed distinct humoral responses and transcriptional profiles in the hamster model compared to the ancestral virus.', 'date': '2021-07-12', 'journal': ''}

Given the inherent adjuvanticity, such modified OMVs can be used as vaccine to induce potent immune responses against the associated protein. Here we show that OMVs engineered to incorporate peptides derived from the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 elicit an effective immune response in immunized mice, resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies. The immunity induced by the vaccine is sufficient to protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing both virus replication in the lungs and the pathology associated with virus infection. Furthermore, we show that OMVs can be effectively decorated with RBM peptides derived from a different genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2, inducing a similarly potent neutralization activity in vaccinated mice.

This work sheds light on the metarules of evolvability that may have shaped the standard genetic code to increase the probability that adaptive point mutations will be generated. Illustrations of the usefulness of visualizing amino acid substitutions in a 3D physicochemical space are shown using recent datasets collected regarding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. First, the substitutions most responsible for antibody escape are almost always inaccessible via single nucleotide mutation, and also change multiple properties concurrently. Second, it is shown that assays of ACE2 binding by sarbecovirus variants, including the viruses responsible for SARS and COVID-19, are more easily understood when plotted with this method.

One of the most important pieces of this host-pathogen interaction is the spike protein, which binds to the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) cell receptor, mediates the membrane fusion and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The multiple amino acid substitutions observed in this region, specially in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), mainly after almost one year of its emergence (late 2020), have enhanced the hACE2 binding affinity and led to several modifications in the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, improving the viral fitness and/or promoting immune evasion, with potential impact in the vaccine development. In this way, the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of positively selected mutations fixed in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineages and to check for mutational evidence of coevolution. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of selected mutations identified in some of the VOC and VOI lineages (C.37, B.1.1.7, P.1, and P.2) of Brazilian samples on the structural stability of the spike protein, as well as their possible association with more aggressive infection profiles by estimating the binding affinity in the RBD-hACE2 complex. We identified 48 sites under selective pressure in Brazilian spike sequences, 17 of them with the strongest evidence by the HyPhy tests, including VOC related mutation sites 138, 142, 222, 262, 484, 681, and 845, among others. The coevolutionary analysis identified a number of 28 coevolving sites that were found not to be conditionally independent, such as the couple E484K - N501Y from P.1 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, the molecular dynamics and free energy estimates showed the structural stabilizing effect and the higher impact of E484K for the improvement of the binding affinity between the spike RBD and the hACE2 in P.1 and P.2 lineages, as well as the stabilizing and destabilizing effects for the positively selected sites.', 'date': '2021-07-19', 'journal': ''}

The sharp rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has made it especially disturbing and is a variant of concern. Fortunately, current vaccines offer protection against known variants of concern, including the Delta variant. However, the Delta variant has exhibited some ability to dodge the immune system as it is found that neutralizing antibodies from prior infections or vaccines are less receptive to binding with the Delta spike protein. Here, we investigated the structural changes caused by the mutations in the Delta variants receptor-binding interface and explored the effects on binding with the ACE2 receptor as well as with neutralizing antibodies. We find that the receptor-binding {beta}-loop-{beta} motif adopts an altered but stable conformation causing separation in some of the antibody binding epitopes. Our study shows reduced binding of neutralizing antibodies and provides a possible mechanism for the immune evasion exhibited by the Delta variant.', 'date': '2021-07-19', 'journal': ''}

Recent data suggests the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-body levels as a good correlate of vaccine mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3 based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time consuming and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2 based, cost effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need, we have developed a BSL2 pseudovirus based neutralization assay (PBNA) in cells expressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible (R2=0.96), demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggests that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20/130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 RSA and B1.1.7 UK VOC, whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants.

We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside of the RBD.

Both nanobodies bind Spike with affinities that exceeded the detection limit (picomolar) of the biolayer interferometry assay and neutralize the original SARS-CoV- 2 strain with IC50 of 0.086 g mL-1 (DL4) and 0.385 g mL-1 (DL28).

As variants of concern arise during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear if mutations accumulated within the spike protein would affect its site-specific glycosylation pattern. The Alpha variant derived from the D614G lineage is distinguished from others by having deletion mutations located right within an immunogenic supersite of the spike N-terminal domain that make it refractory to most neutralizing antibodies directed against this domain. Despite maintaining an overall similar structural conformation, our mass spectrometry-based site-specific glycosylation analyses of similarly produced spike proteins with and without the D614G and Alpha variant mutations reveal a significant shift in the processing state of N-glycans on one specific N-terminal domain site. Its conversion to a higher proportion of complex type structures is indicative of altered spatial accessibility attributable to mutations specific to the Alpha variant that may impact its transmissibility.

The use of mouse AdV type 1 (MAV-1) in its natural host allows infection to be studied under replicative conditions. Here, we orally vaccinated mice with MAV-1 vectors expressing the full length or the "headless" hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza to assess the protection conferred against an intranasal challenge of influenza. We showed that while the headless HA vector did not generate a significant humoral or cellular immune response to influenza, a single oral immunisation with the full-length HA vaccine generated influenza-specific and neutralizing antibodies and completely protected the mice against clinical signs and viral replication.\n\nImportanceGiven the constant threat of pandemics and the need for annual vaccination against influenza and possibly emerging agents such as SARS-CoV-2, new types of vaccines that are easier to produce and administer and therefore more widely accepted are a critical public health need.

Epitope mapping revealed that the binding site is a key determinant of neutralization potency, rather than affinity alone. The most potent nanobodies bind to the receptor binding motif of the RBD, directly preventing interaction with the host cell receptor ACE2, and we identify two exceptionally potent members of this category (with monomeric IC50s around 13 and 16 ng/ml).

For RBD-alpha, the ACE2-binding affinity was increased by a factor of ten when compared with RBD-WT, while ACE2-binding of RBD-beta was largely unaffected. However, when challenged with a neutralizing antibody that binds to both RBD-WT and RBD-alpha with low nanomolar KD values, RBD-beta displayed no binding, suggesting a substantial epitope change. In SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera, RBD-binding antibodies showed low nanomolar affinities to both wild-type and variant RBD proteins--strikingly, the concentration of antibodies binding to RBD-beta was half that of RBD-WT and RBD-alpha, again indicating considerable epitope changes in the beta variant. Our data therefore suggests that one factor contributing to the higher transmissibility and antibody evasion of SARS-CoV-2 alpha and beta is a larger fraction of viruses that can form a complex with ACE2. However, the two variants employ different mechanisms to achieve this goal. While SARS-CoV-2 alpha RBD binds with greater affinity to ACE2 and is thus more difficult to displace from the receptor by neutralizing antibodies, RBD-beta is less accessible to antibodies due to epitope changes which increases the chances of ACE2-binding and infection.', 'date': '2021-07-26', 'journal': ''}

In the hamster model, prophylactic SAB-185 treatment protected the hamsters from fatal disease and minimized clinical signs of infection. These results suggest that SAB-185 may be an effective treatment for patients infected with SARS CoV-2 variants.', 'date': '2021-07-26', 'journal': ''}

The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests that additional outbreaks are likely to occur. Evidence suggests that neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against infection with CoVs. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing pan-coronavirus protection. To this end, we previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 fusion machinery, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes SARS-CoV-1 and displays cross reactive binding to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of CV3-25 is also maintained against the Alpha, Delta and Gamma variants of concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region on sarbecovirus spikes. A 1.74[A] crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs.

Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the "cold chain" transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS- CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development.

B.; Merrill, A. E.; Knudson, C. M.; Brown, G.; Maury, W.; Haim, H.', 'abstract': 'The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is arranged as a trimer on the virus surface, composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits. Infected and vaccinated individuals generate antibodies against spike, which can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1; however, antibodies against other regions of spike have also been isolated. The variation between infected individuals in domain specificity of the antibodies and in their relative neutralization efficacy is still poorly characterized. To this end, we tested serum and plasma samples from 85 COVID-19 convalescent subjects using 7 immunoassays that employ different domains, subunits and oligomeric forms of spike to capture the antibodies. Samples were also tested for their neutralization of pseudovirus containing SARS-CoV-2 spike and of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. We observed strong correlations between the levels of NTD- and RBD-specific antibodies, with a fixed ratio of each type to all anti-spike antibodies. The relative potency of the response (defined as the measured neutralization efficacy relative to the total level of spike-targeting antibodies) also exhibited limited variation between subjects, and was not associated with the overall amount of anti-spike antibodies produced. Accordingly, the ability of immunoassays that use RBD, NTD and different forms of S1 or S1/S2 as capture antigens to estimate the neutralizing efficacy of convalescent samples was largely similar. These studies suggest that host-to-host variation in the polyclonal response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 spike is primarily limited to the quantity of antibodies generated rather than their domain specificity or relative neutralization potency.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD, NTD and S2. Different infected individuals generate vastly different amounts of anti-spike antibodies. By contrast, as we show here, there is a remarkable similarity in the properties of the antibodies produced. Different individuals generate the same proportions of antibodies against each domain of the spike protein. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of anti-spike antibodies produced and their neutralization efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved. Therefore, the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or relative antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.', 'date': '2021-08-05', 'journal': ''}

By combining plasma-selected spike substitutions, we generated synthetic  polymutant spike proteins that resisted polyclonal antibody neutralization to a similar degree as currently circulating variants of concern (VOC). Importantly, by aggregating VOC-associated and plasma-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike are sufficient to confer near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescents and mRNA vaccine recipients. Strikingly however, plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination, neutralized this highly resistant SARS-CoV-2 polymutant, and also neutralized diverse sarbecoviruses.

VHH60 competes with human ACE2 to bind the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein with a KD of 2.56 nM, inhibits infections of both live SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses harboring wildtype, escape mutations and prevailing variants at nanomolar level. VHH60 also suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation 50-fold better and protects mice from death two times longer than that of control group after live virus inoculation on mice. VHH60 therefore is a powerful synthetic nanobody with a promising profile for disease control against COVID19.', 'date': '2021-08-09', 'journal': ''}

Consequently, novel and more efficacious agents are urgently needed. We have developed a bispecific antibody, 2022, consisting of two antibodies, 2F8 and VHH18. 2F8 was isolated from our proprietary fully synthetic human IDEAL (Intelligently Designed and Engineered Antibody Library)-VH/VL library and VHH18 is a single domain antibody isolated from IDEAL-nanobody library. 2022 was constructed by attaching VHH18 to the C-terminal of Fc of 2F8. 2022 binds two non-overlapping epitopes simultaneously on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocks the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 2022 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and all of the variants tested in both pseudovirus and live virus assays, including variants carrying mutations known to resist neutralizing antibodies approved under EUA and that reduce the protection efficiency of current effective vaccines. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2022 is 270 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, and 1 pM, for wild-type, alpha, beta, and delta pseudovirus, respectively. In the live virus assay, 2022 has an IC50 of 26.4 pM, 13.3 pM, and 88.6 pM, for wild-type, beta, and delta live virus, respectively. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, 2022 showed strong prophylactic and therapeutic effects. A single administration of 2022 intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) 24 hours before virus challenge completely protected all mice from bodyweight loss, as compared with up to 20% loss of bodyweight in placebo treated mice. In addition, the lung viral titers were undetectable (FRNT assay) in all mice treated with 2022 either prophylactically or therapeutically, as compared with around 1x105 pfu/g lung tissue in placebo treated mice.

Previous studies have shown that antibodies that cross-react with thrombopoietin, a regulator of platelet production, can induce thrombocytopenia which is characterized by low platelet count. Thrombocytopenia is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients and is a rare side effect following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show molecular mimicry between the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, and human thrombopoietin. Our computational analyses identify a shared five-amino acid long sequence motif (TQLPP) with similar structure and antibody-binding properties for these proteins, strongly indicative of molecular mimicry with potential for cross-reactivity. Our results are supported by reports of the presence of antibodies against epitopes containing TQLPP in both COVID-19 and pre-pandemic patient samples, indicating antibody cross-reactivity between Spike and a human protein. Since the Spike protein is the antigenic component of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, altering the motif may reduce the risk for thrombocytopenia and improve long-term protection against evolving variants. Our findings highlight the importance of considering peptide-level molecular mimicry when developing therapeutic interventions and designing vaccines to avoid potential autoimmune reactions.', 'date': '2021-08-11', 'journal': ''}

Of these, 944 from naive and 2,299 from convalescents produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and 411 of them neutralized the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naive people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naive people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern.

T.; Acharya, A.; Lynch, D.; Pavlova, A.; Gumbart, J.', 'abstract': 'The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein, which protrudes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope, is responsible for binding to human ACE2 receptors. The binding process is initiated when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of at least one protomer switches from a "down" (closed) to an "up" (open) state. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations to investigate the transition between the two S-protein conformations with and without glycosylation. We show that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening than the non-glycosylated one with comparable populations of the down and up states. In contrast, we observed that the up conformation is favored without glycans. Analysis of the S-protein opening pathway reveals that glycans at N165 and N122 interfere with hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the N-terminal domain in the up state. We also identify roles for glycans at N165 and N343 in stabilizing the down and up states. Finally we estimate how epitope exposure for several known antibodies changes along the opening path. We find that the epitope of the BD-368-2 antibody remains exposed irrespective of the S-protein conformation, explaining the high efficacy of this antibody.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC="FIGDIR/small/456168v1_ufig1.gif" ALT="Figure 1">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fcc0a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cb97cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5bbe6corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@132ca97_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG', 'date': '2021-08-13', 'journal': ''}
{'title': 'SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization in Commercial Lots of Plasma-derived Immunoglobulin', 'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.13.456066', 'authors': 'Volk, A.; Covini-Souris, C.; Kuehnel, D.; de Mey, C.; Roemisch, J.; Schmidt, T.', 'abstract': 'IntroductionPatients suffering from primary or secondary immunodeficiency (PID or SID) face times of increased insecurity and discomfort in the light of the raging COVID-19 pandemic, not knowing if and to what extent their comorbidities impact the course of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients of this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG).\n\nWhether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated, e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency remains a pressing question for this patient population.\n\nPurposeWe investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until 06/2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from 05/2020 to 08/2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present.\n\nMethodsFinal containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 plasma single donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations.\n\nResultsCP donations presented with a high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were none/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 1000 IU/mL.\n\nIVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities of SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021, entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 20 IU/mL in 12/2020 to 505 IU/mL in 06/2021 with a maximum of 864 IU/mL for the most recent lots.\n\nPharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published PK investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16 IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from 05/2021 of 216 IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64 IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in 06/2021.\n\nConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients.\n\nPlain Language SummaryPeople with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens, e.g., bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins (Ig)) are prepared from plasma of healthy donors, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells. This plasma is then split up in pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864 IU/mL. Considering that the USA represents Octapharmas main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the IVIG/SCIG neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially meet a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection.\n\nKey PointsO_LIPatients with humoral immunodeficiency rely on plasma-derived immunoglobulin for passive immunization against numerous pathogens.\nC_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities of plasma-derived immunoglobulins have increased over time with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination campaigns.\nC_LIO_LIPlasma-derived immunoglobulin in prophylactic use for immunodeficient patients could potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.\nC_LI', 'date': '2021-08-13', 'journal': ''}

However, at the virus-host interface, additional biomolecular interactions, although being relatively weak in affinity and low in specificity, could also contribute to viral attachment and play important roles in gain- or loss-of-function mutations. In this work, we performed a peptide scanning of the S1 domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by synthesizing 972 16-mer native and mutated peptide fragments using a high throughput in situ array synthesis technology. By probing the array using fluorescently labelled ACE2, a number of previously unknown potential receptor binding sites of S1 have been revealed. 20 peptides were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis, in order to validate and quantify their binding to ACE2. Four ACE2-binding peptides were selected, to investigate whether they can be assembled through a biotinylated peptide/neutravidin system to achieve high affinity to ACE2.

But the new viral variants can reduce the efficacy of the currently available antibodies, as well as diminish the vaccine induced immunity. Here, we demonstrate how the microscopic dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, can be modulated by the mutations present in the spike proteins of the variants currently circulating in the world population. We show that the dynamical perturbation in the antibody structure can be diverse, depending both on the nature of the antibody and on the location of the mutation. The correlated motion between the antibody and the receptor binding domain (RBD) can also be changed, altering the binding affinity. By constructing a protein graph connectivity network, we could delineate the mutant induced modifications in the allosteric information flow pathway through the antibody, and observed the presence of both localized and long distance effects. We identified a loop consisting of residues 470-490 in the RBD which works like an anchor preventing the detachment of the antibodies, and individual mutations in that region can significantly affect the antibody binding propensity.

These results advance our molecular understanding of distinct properties of these viruses and may guide intervention strategies.', 'date': '2021-08-17', 'journal': ''}

The spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of RaTG13 contains a large number of amino acid substitutions when compared to SARS-CoV-2, likely impacting affinity for the ACE2 receptor. Antigenic differences between the viruses are less well understood, especially whether RaTG13 spike can be efficiently neutralised by antibodies generated from infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Using RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes we compared neutralisation using convalescent sera from previously infected patients as well as vaccinated healthcare workers. Surprisingly, our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike chimeras and mutants harbouring single amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically reducing how efficiently they are neutralised. Moreover, introducing the 484K mutation into RaTG13 resulted in increased neutralisation, in contrast to the same mutation in SARS-CoV-2 (E484K). This is despite E484K having a well-documented role in immune evasion in variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.351 (Beta). These results indicate that the immune-escape mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be driven by strong antibody pressures, and that the future spill-over of RaTG13 and/or related sarbecoviruses could be mitigated using current SARS-CoV-2-based vaccination strategies.', 'date': '2021-08-17', 'journal': ''}

J.; Verardi, P.; Tarakanova, A.', 'abstract': 'The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency requiring urgent development of efficacious vaccines. While concentrated research efforts are underway to develop antibody-based vaccines that would neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccine candidates are currently in Phase III clinical trials or have received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e. neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data, and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long-term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins, and present a new approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe present novel dynamic mechanisms of coronavirus S proteins that encode antibody binding and cellular fusion properties. These mechanisms may offer an explanation for the widespread nature of SARS-CoV-2 and more limited spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. A comprehensive computational characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures and dynamics provides insights into structural and thermal stability associated with a variety of S protein mutants. These findings allow us to make recommendations about the future mutant design of SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants that are optimized to elicit neutralizing antibodies, resist structural rearrangements that aid cellular fusion, and are thermally stabilized. The integrated computational approach can be applied to optimize vaccine immunogen design and predict escape of vaccine-induced antibody responses by SARS-CoV-2 variants.', 'date': '2021-08-19', 'journal': ''}

However, the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study, we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses, including those specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory.

The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in mice.\n\nResults, Conclusions, and SignificanceThe RBD203-N1 production process yielded 492.9 {+/-} 3.0 mg/L of protein in the fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a >96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55 {+/-} 3% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5 {+/-} 13.2 mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized as a homogeneous monomer with well-defined secondary structure, thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on alum and CpG, it was immunogenic and induced robust levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

A.', 'abstract': 'SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans and a wide range of animal species. Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization.\n\nAuthor summaryCells stably expressing ACE2 from various animals and a lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus assay were established to study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The results demonstrated that ACE2 from a wide range of animal species facilitate S-mediated virus entry into cells, which is supported by in silico data as well as natural and experimental infection studies. Pseudotyped viruses containing mutations in the RBD of S representative of the Alpha, Gamma, and especially Beta, variants of concern demonstrated that certain mutations are associated with increased viral entry compared to the parental S. The Beta variant was also observed to have a replicative advantage in vitro and in vivo compared to the prototype virus. Pseudotyped viruses containing combinatorial substitutions of 501Y-484K-417K, 614G-501Y-484K and 614G-501Y-484K-417N increased viral entry via ACE2 across multiple species. The 501Y or 478K single substitution did not significantly affect neutralizing capacity of immune sera compared to the prototype strain, but the addition of 484K or 452R substitutions significantly reduced the neutralizing titers.', 'date': '2021-08-25', 'journal': ''}

A single dose vaccination induced the strong immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The induced neutralizing antibodies (NAs) titers were maintained at a high peak level of over 1:1024 even after more than one year of injection and accompanied with functional T-cells responses in mice. Importantly, both ssAAV- and scAAV-based RBD-plus vaccines exhibited high levels of serum NAs against current circulating variants including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge test showed that ssAAV5-RBD-plus vaccine protected both young and old age mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and the lower respiratory tracts. Moreover, whole genome sequencing demonstrated that AAV vector DNA sequences were not found in the genome of the vaccinated mice after one year vaccination, demonstrating excellent safety of the vaccine.

A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six proline stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from Neisseria meningitidis. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs seven days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung.

To date, the spike protein has become the principal target for vaccine and therapeutic development while the exact effects of its glycosylation remain elusive. Experimental reports have described the heterogeneity of the spike protein glycosylation profile. Subsequent molecular simulation studies provided a knowledge basis of the glycan functions. However, there are no studies to date on the role of discrete glycoforms on the spike protein pathobiology. Building an understanding of its role in SARS-CoV-2 is important as we continue to develop effective medicines and vaccines to combat the disease. Herein, we used designed combinations of glycoengineering enzymes to simplify and control the glycosylation profile of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Measurements of the receptor binding affinity revealed the regulatory effects of the RBD glycans. Remarkably, opposite effects were observed from differently remodeled glycans, which presents a potential strategy for modulating the spike protein behaviors through glycoengineering. Moreover, we found that the reported anti-SARS-CoV-(2) antibody, S309, neutralizes the impact of different RBD glycoforms on the receptor binding affinity. Overall, this work reports the regulatory roles that glycosylation plays in the interaction between the viral spike protein and host receptor, providing new insights into the nature of SARS-CoV-2.

Opposite regulatory effects were observed and were determined by discrete glycan structures, which can be neutralized by the reported S309 antibody binding to the S protein.

Pigtail macaques (PTM, Macaca nemestrina) demonstrate a rapid and severe disease course when infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), including the development of severe cardiovascular symptoms that are pertinent to COVID-19 manifestations in humans. We thus proposed this species may likewise exhibit severe COVID-19 disease upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we extensively studied a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected PTM euthanized either 6- or 21-days after respiratory viral challenge. We show that PTM demonstrate largely mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease. Pulmonary infiltrates were dominated by T cells, including CD4+ T cells that upregulate CD8 and express cytotoxic molecules, as well as virus-targeting T cells that were predominantly CD4+. We also noted increases in inflammatory and coagulation markers in blood, pulmonary pathologic lesions, and the development of neutralizing antibodies. Together, our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of PTM recapitulates important features of COVID-19 and reveals new immune and viral dynamics and thus may serve as a useful animal model for studying pathogenesis and testing vaccines and therapeutics.', 'date': '2021-08-30', 'journal': ''}

I.; Freddolino, P.; Zhang, F.; Koonin, E. V.', 'abstract': 'At the time of this writing, August 2021, potential emergence of vaccine escape variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a grave global concern. The interface between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the host receptor (ACE2) overlap with the binding site of principal neutralizing antibodies (NAb), limiting the repertoire of viable mutations. Nonetheless, variants with multiple mutations in the RBD have rose to dominance. Non-additive, epistatic relationships among RBD mutations are apparent, and assessing the impact of such epistasis on the mutational landscape is crucial. Epistasis can substantially increase the risk of vaccine escape and cannot be completely characterized through the study of the wild type (WT) alone. We employed protein structure modeling using Rosetta to compare the effects of all single mutants at the RBD-NAb and RBD-ACE2 interfaces for the WT, Gamma (417T, 484K, 501Y), and Delta variants (452R, 478K). Overall, epistasis at the RBD surface appears to be limited and the effects of most multiple mutations are additive. Epistasis at the Delta variant interface weakly stabilizes NAb interaction relative to ACE2, whereas in the Gamma variant, epistasis more substantially destabilizes NAb interaction. These results suggest that the repertoire of potential escape mutations for the Delta variant is not substantially different from that of the WT, whereas Gamma poses a moderately greater risk for enhanced vaccine escape. Thus, the modest ensemble of mutations relative to the WT shown to reduce vaccine efficacy might constitute the majority of all possible escape mutations.\n\nSignificancePotential emergence of vaccine escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 is arguably the most pressing problem during the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines are distributed worldwide. We employed a computational approach to assess the risk of antibody escape resulting from mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the Gamma and Delta variants. The results indicate that emergence of escape mutants is somewhat less likely for the Delta variant than for the wild type and moderately more likely for the Gamma variant. We conclude that the small set of escape-enhancing mutations already identified for the wild type is likely to include the majority of all possible mutations with this effect, a welcome finding.', 'date': '2021-08-31', 'journal': ''}

The initial step of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in its spike protein to ACE2 receptor in host cell membrane.

Besides the well-known single mutation in RBD, the recent new mutation strains with RBD "double mutation" is causing new outbreaks globally, as represented by the delta strain containing RBD L452R/T478K. Although it is considered that the increased transmissibility of the double mutated strains could be attributed to the alteration of mutated RBD to ACE2 receptor, the molecular details remains to be unclear. Using the methods of molecular dynamics simulation, superimposed structural comparison, free binding energy estimation and antibody escaping, we investigated the relationship between ACE2 receptor and the RBD double mutant L452R/T478K (delta), L452R/E484Q (kappa) and E484K/N501Y (beta, gamma).

Clonal Mast Cells Activation Disorders (cMCADs) such as mastocytosis and clonal mast cells activation syndrome are characterized by an abnormal mast cells accumulation and/or activation. No data have been published on the anti-viral immune response of patients with cMCADs. The aims of the study were to collected, in a comprehensive way, outcomes of cMCADs patients who experienced a biologically-proven COVID-19 and to characterize both anti-endemic coronaviruses and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in these patients. Clinical follow-up and outcome data were collected prospectively for one year within the French rare disease network CEREMAST encompassing patients from all over the country. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-endemic coronaviruses specific T-cells were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (EliSpot) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response with dosage of circulating levels of specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. Overall, 32 cMCADs patients were identified. None of them required non-invasive or mechanical ventilation; two patients were hospitalized to receive oxygen and steroid therapy. In 21 patients, a characterization of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response has been performed. A majority of patients showed a high proportion of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon (IFN)-{gamma} producing T-cells and high levels of anti-Spike IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity. In addition, no defects in anti-endemic coronaviruses responses were found in patients with cMCADs compared to non-cMCADs controls. Patients with cMCADs frequently showed a spontaneous IFN-{gamma} T-cell production in absence of any stimulation that correlated with circulating basal tryptase levels, a marker of mast cells burden. These findings underscore that patients with cMCADs might be not at risk of severe COVID-19 and the spontaneous IFN-{gamma} production might explain this observation.\n\nAuthor SummaryMast cells are immune cells involved in many biological processes including the anti-microbial response. However, previous studies suggest that mast cells may have a detrimental role in the response against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, responsible for COVID-19. When a mutation occurs in mast cells, it can lead to a group of diseases called clonal mast cells activation disorders (cMCADs), characterized by deregulated activation of these cells. Hence, patients with cMCADs might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than general population.\n\nWe therefore conducted a 1-year study in France to collect data from all cMCADs patients included in the CEREMAST rare disease French network and who experienced COVID-19. Interestingly, we did not find any severe COVID-19 (i.e. requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) in spite of well-known risk factors for severe COVID-19 in a part of cMCADs patients.\n\nWe then have studied the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic coronaviruses in these patients. We did not observe any abnormalities in the immune response either at the level of T and B lymphocytes. These findings underscore that these patients might not be at risk of severe COVID-19 as one might have feared.', 'date': '2021-09-01', 'journal': ''}

Both variants demonstrate escape of antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain, an important immune hotspot for neutralizing epitopes. Compared to wild-type and Kappa lineages, Delta variant spike proteins show modest increase in ACE2 affinity, likely due to enhanced electrostatic complementarity at the RBD-ACE2 interface, which we characterize by cryo-EM. Unexpectedly, Kappa variant spike trimers form a novel head-to-head dimer-of-trimers assembly, which we demonstrate is a result of the E484Q mutation.

H.', 'abstract': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease characterized by strong induction of inflammatory cytokines, progressive lung inflammation and potentially multi-organ dysfunction. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs, including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced type I IFN and cytokine responses, which was inhibited by antibodies against ACE2. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS-CoV-2. These data imply that SARS-CoV-2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 early during infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe immune system needs to recognize pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to initiate antiviral immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for inducing antiviral immunity and are therefore equipped with both extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors to sense pathogens. However, it is unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 activates DCs. Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by extracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We have previously shown that DCs do not express ACE2, and are therefore not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that DCs do not become activated by exposure to viral Spike proteins or SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. These findings suggest that TLR4 and other extracellular TLRs do not sense SARS-CoV-2. Next, we expressed ACE2 in DCs and SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected these ACE2-positive DCs. Notably, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced an antiviral immune response. Thus, our study suggests that infection of DCs is required for induction of immunity, and thus that intracellular viral sensors rather than extracellular TLRs are important in sensing SARS-CoV-2. Lack of sensing by extracellular TLRs might be an escape mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and could contribute to the aberrant immune responses observed during COVID-19.', 'date': '2021-09-03', 'journal': ''}

The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has received special attention as it is the means by which the virus enters the human host cells. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is one of the targeted regions of the Spike protein for therapeutics and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Though its function is not well-understood, the NTD is reported to acquire mutations and deletions that can accelerate the evolutionary adaptation of the virus driving antibody escape. Cellular processes are known to be regulated by complex interactions at the molecular level, which can be characterized by means of a graph representation facilitating the identification of key residues and critical communication pathways within the molecular complex. From extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire Spike for the wild-type and the dominant variant, we derive a weighted graph representation of the protein in two dominant conformations of the receptor-binding-domain; all-down and one-up. We implement graph theory techniques to characterize the relevance of specific residues at facilitating roles of communication and control, while uncovering key implications for fitness and adaptation. We find that many of the reported high-frequency mutations tend to occur away from the critical residues highlighted by our graph theory analysis, implying that these mutations tend to avoid targeting residues that are most critical for protein allosteric communication. We propose that these critical residues could be candidate targets for novel antibody therapeutics. In addition, our analysis provides quantitative insights of the critical role of the NTD and furin cleavage site and their wide-reaching influence over the protein at large. Many of our conclusions are supported by empirical evidence while others point the way towards crucial simulation-guided experiments.', 'date': '2021-09-04', 'journal': ''}

Notably, several recent studies have revealed that vaccination of recovered COVID-19 donors results in enhanced nAb responses compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination alone 10-13. Here, we utilized a targeted donor selection strategy to isolate a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to sarbecoviruses from two such donors. Many of the bnAbs are remarkably effective in neutralization against sarbecoviruses that use ACE2 for viral entry and also show strong binding to non-ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. The bnAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs compared to the original virus. Neutralization breadth is achieved by bnAb binding to epitopes on a relatively conserved face of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as opposed to strain-specific nAbs to the receptor binding site that are commonly elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination 14-18. The generation of a large panel of potent bnAbs provides new opportunities and choices for next-generation antibody prophylactic and therapeutic applications and, importantly, provides a basis for effective design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.', 'date': '2021-09-08', 'journal': ''}

It should also be well accepted by the population and have a simple logistic chain. To fulfill these criteria, we developed a thermostable, orally administered vaccine that can induce a robust mucosal neutralizing immune response. We used our platform based on retrovirus-derived enveloped virus-like particles (e-VLPs) harnessed with variable surface proteins (VSPs) from the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, affording them resistance to degradation and the triggering of robust mucosal cellular and antibody immune responses after oral administration. We made e-VLPs expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), with or without membrane protein (M) expression. We found that prime-boost administration of VSP-decorated e-VLPs expressing a pre-fusion stabilized form of S and M triggers robust mucosal responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters, which translate into complete protection from a viral challenge. Moreover, they dramatically boosted the IgA mucosal response of intramuscularly injected vaccines. We conclude that our thermostable orally administered e-VLP vaccine could be a valuable addition to the current arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, in a stand-alone prime-boost vaccination strategy or as a boost for existing vaccines.', 'date': '2021-09-09', 'journal': ''}

Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice.

While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (Fc{gamma}RIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, support the clinical use of currently available antibody-based treatment including the continued study of CCP transfusion strategies.', 'date': '2021-09-16', 'journal': ''}

In this study, we examined this concept by characterizing anti-spike IgG from a cohort of non-hospitalized convalescent individuals with a spectrum of COVID-19 severity. We observed that anti-spike IgG levels positively correlated with disease severity, higher IgG cross-reactivity against betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and OC43), and higher levels of proinflammatory Fc gamma receptor 2a and 3a (Fc{gamma}R2a & Fc{gamma}R3a) activation. In examining the levels of IgG targeting betacoronavirus conserved and immunodominant epitopes versus disease severity, we observed a positive correlation with the levels of IgG targeting the conserved S2FP region, and an inverse correlation with two conserved epitopes around the heptad repeat (HR) 2 region. In comparing the levels of IgG targeting non-conserved epitopes, we observed that only one of three non-conserved immunodominant epitopes correlated with disease severity. Notably, the levels of IgG targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) were inversely correlated with severity. Importantly, targeting of the RBD and HR2 regions have both been shown to mediate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. These findings show that, aside from antibody (Ab) targeting of the RBD region, humoral memory responses against seasonal betacoronaviruses are potentially an important factor in dictating COVID-19 severity, with anti-HR2-dominant Ab profiles representing protective memory responses, while an anti-S2FP dominant Ab profiles indicate deleterious recall responses. Though these profiles are masked in whole antigen profiling, these analyses suggest that distinct Ab memory responses are detectable with epitope targeting analysis. These findings have important implications for predicting severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections (primary and reinfections), and may predict vaccine efficacy in subpopulations with different dominant antibody epitope profiles.', 'date': '2021-09-16', 'journal': ''}

Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.', 'date': '2021-09-23', 'journal': ''}

Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta-variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future.

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates type I interferon, myeloid, and inflammatory signatures similar to human disease, and that weight loss can be prevented with vaccines. However, the impact of vaccination on transcriptional programs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis and protective adaptive immune responses is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters stimulates antiviral, myeloid, and inflammatory programs as well as signatures of complement and thrombosis associated with human COVID-19. Notably, single dose immunization with Ad26.COV2.S, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector (Ad26)-based vaccine expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, prevents the upregulation of these pathways such that the gene expression profiles of vaccinated hamsters are comparable to uninfected animals.

In this work, we aimed to explore the landscape of linear B cell epitopes on the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins of global PEDV strains. All amino acid sequences of the PEDV S and M proteins were retrieved from the NCBI database and grouped. Immunoinformatics-based methods were next developed and used to identify putative linear B cell epitopes from 14 and 5 consensus sequences generated from distinct groups of the S and M proteins, respectively. ELISA testing predicted peptides with PEDV-positive sera revealed 9 novel immunodominant epitopes on the S protein.

Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential escape mutations by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue.\n\nResultsIndividuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination.\n\nConclusionsThe finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by NIH grants AI138709 (PI Overbaugh) and AI146028 (PI Matsen).

Patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding NaV1.7, experience anosmia in addition to congenital insensitivity to pain. Tsp1a is a recently discovered peptide that inhibits NaV1.7 with high potency and selectivity. In this study, we examined whether a fluorescently tagged version of Tsp1a could be used to visualize normal and damaged mouse olfactory nerves.\n\nMethodsAthymic nude mice were intravenously injected with Tsp1a-IR800. As a control, mice were injected with PBS only, and as a blocking control were injected with combination of Tsp1a and Tsp1a-IR800. All mice were imaged in-vivo and epifluorescence images were acquired using an IVIS Spectrum animal imaging system. Semiquantitative analysis of the Tsp1a-IR800 signal was conducted by measuring the average radiant efficiency in the region of the olfactory epithelium/bulb (ROEB). Methimazole was used to chemically ablate the olfactory epithelium. We performed a food buried test to correlate the level of anosmia with the level of radiance efficiency.\n\nResultsThe area of olfactory epithelium/bulb was clearly visible in epifluorescence in-vivo images of mice receiving the imaging agent. The radiant efficiency was significantly less in both mice injected with PBS and in mice injected with the blocking formulation. The mice after olfactory ablation had a significantly reduced radiant efficiency compared with normal mice. Moreover, there was a statistically significant and inverse correlation between the time required for the mouse to find buried food and the radiant efficiency. We also performed immunohistochemistry using NaV1.7 antibody. Mice after olfactory ablation as well as COVID-19-infected mice had significantly lower expression of NaV1.7 on the level of olfactory epithelium/bulb.\n\nConclusionWe show that the fluorescent imaging of mouse olfactory epithelium/bulb is possible, suggesting that labeled Tsp1a tracers may serve as the first objective diagnostic tool of smell disorders, including those caused by COVID-19.', 'date': '2021-10-08', 'journal': ''}

In the current study we performed Free energy of perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate it possible impact on a set of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which have been shown to be strong inhibitors of the most other known COVID-19 variants. Our results show that R346K affects the class 2 antibodies but its effect is not so significant (0.66 kcal/mol); i.e. reduces the binding with RBD about 3 times. An identical value was calculated also in the presence of both class 1 and class 2 antibodies (BD-812/836). Further, a similar reduction in the binding (0.4 kcal/mol) was obtained for BD-821/771 pair of mAbs.

Here, we describe a bead-based screening assay for S1-neutralization using recombinant fluorescent proteins of hACE2 and SARS-CoV2-S1, immobilized on solid beads employing nanobodies /metal-affinity tags. Nanobody-mediated capture of SARS-CoV-2 - Spike (S1) on agarose beads served as the trap for soluble recombinant ACE2-GFPSpark, inhibited by neutralizing antibody. The first approach demonstrates single-color fluorescent imaging of ACE2-GFPspark binding to His-tagged S1-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD-His) immobilized beads. The second approach is dual-color imaging of soluble ACE2-GFPSpark to S1-Orange Fluorescent Protein (S1-OFPSpark) beads. Both methods showed a good correlation with the gold standard pseudovirion assay and can be adapted to any fluorescent platforms for screening. Life-time imaging of the ACE2-GFPSpark confirmed the interaction of ACE2 and S1-OFPSpark on beads. The self-renewable source of secreted recombinant proteins from stable cells and its direct use without necessitating purification renders the platform a cost-effective and rapid one than the popular pseudovirion assay and live virus-based assays.

Research efforts have focused on antibodies that neutralize the ACE2-Spike interaction but not on non-neutralizing antibodies. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis is an immune mechanism enhanced by opsonization, where typically, more bound antibodies trigger a stronger phagocyte response. Here, we show that Spike-specific antibodies, dependent on concentration, can either enhance or reduce Spike-bead phagocytosis by monocytes independently of the antibody neutralization potential. Surprisingly, we find that both convalescent patient plasma and patient-derived monoclonal antibodies lead to maximum opsonization already at low levels of bound antibodies and is reduced as antibody binding to Spike protein increases. Moreover, we show that this Spike-dependent modulation of opsonization seems to affect the outcome in an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection model.

Although countless efforts to control the pandemic have been attempted--most successfully, vaccination--imbalances in accessibility to vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics among countries, regions, and populations have been problematic. Camelid variable regions of heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs or nanobodies) have unique modalities: they are smaller, more stable, easier to customize, and, importantly, less expensive to produce than conventional antibodies. We present the sequences of nine alpaca nanobodies that detect the spike proteins of four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs)--namely, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants. We show that they can quantify or detect spike variants via ELISA and lateral flow, kinetic, flow cytometric, microscopy, and Western blotting assays. The panel of nanobodies broadly neutralized viral infection by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Structural analyses showed that a P86 clone targeted epitopes that were conserved yet unclassified on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and located inside the N-terminal domain (NTD). Human antibodies have hardly accessed both regions; consequently, the clone buries hidden crevasses of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins undetected by conventional antibodies and maintains activity against spike proteins carrying escape mutations.', 'date': '2021-10-26', 'journal': ''}
