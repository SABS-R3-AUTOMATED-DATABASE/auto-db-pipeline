These RBD antibodies ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamster models in a dose-dependent manner and in proportion to in\u00a0vitro, neutralizing potency. Assessing the effect of mutations in the spike protein on antibody recognition and neutralization highlights both potent single antibodies and stereotypic classes of antibodies that are unaffected by currently circulating VOCs, such as B.1.351 and P.1.

We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme.

We show that a germline revertant antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizes virus, and that gains in affinity for the RBD do not necessarily correlate with increased neutralization potency, suggesting that somatic mutation is not required to exert robust antiviral effect.

Cryo-EM studies dissected the nature of the P17 epitope, which is SARS-CoV-2 specific and distinctly different from that of H014. High-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with H014 and P17, together with functional investigations revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, synergistic neutralization was achieved by S1 shielding and conformational locking, thereby blocking receptor attachment and viral membrane fusion, conferring high potency as well as robustness against viral mutation escape.

Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml.

The scFv76-cluster antibodies (scFv76-cl Abs) exhibit high affinity for the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of Wuhan strain and emerging variants, leading to inhibition of RBD/human ACE2 interaction. The antigenic epitope recognized by scFv76 was mapped in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of RBD at residues L455, F456, Y473, N487 and Y489. None of these residues has been to date listed among the RBD mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), suggesting an important role of such epitope in viral infectivity. Treatment with scFv76-cl Abs is effective against SARS-CoV-2, as determined by in vitro experiments of viral infection, replication, cytopathogenicity and spike-mediated syncytia formation. Moreover, their intranasal administration is shown to counteract infection in two independent animal models. Overall, the biochemical and biological characteristics of scFv76-cl Abs are compatible with their clinical use for COVID-19 therapy by intranasal or aerosol administration. To our knowledge, this is the first example of promising human anti-SARS-CoV-2 scFv antibodies as drug candidates for COVID-19 therapy."], ["Structures of potent and convergent neutralizing antibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike unveil a unique epitope responsible for exceptional potency | bioRxiv", "Understanding the mechanism of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for effective vaccines and therapeutics development.

Here we report the 3.5-\u00c5 cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2\u2019s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer.

One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group\u00a01 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group\u00a02 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD\u2013ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group\u00a02 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, and\u2014to our knowledge\u2014rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised."], ["Structural Basis for Potent Neutralization of Betacoronaviruses by Single-Domain Camelid Antibodies - ScienceDirect", "Coronaviruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze membrane fusion.

To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations. They were panned against different HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG).

These results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 compared to SARS CoV and Hendra virus. HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens."], ["A dominant antigenic epitope on SARS-CoV spike protein identified by an avian single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-expressing phage - ScienceDirect", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emergent human disease, which requires rapid diagnosis and effective therapy.

Structure determination and mutagenesis experiments reveal the epitope and critical residues on the NTD for 7D10 binding and neutralization. Further experiments indicate that the neutralization by 7D10 is not solely dependent on the inhibition of DPP4 binding, but also acts after viral cell attachment, inhibiting the pre-fusion to post-fusion conformational change of the spike.

We also determined high-resolution structures of the trimeric MERS-CoV S ectodomain in complex with G4, a stem-directed neutralizing antibody. The structures reveal that G4 recognizes a glycosylated loop that is variable among coronaviruses and they define four conformational states of the trimer wherein each receptor-binding domain is either tightly packed at the membrane-distal apex or rotated into a receptor-accessible conformation.

While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intra-species transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneous- and cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) \u201chot spot\u201d in a light chain CDR (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution."], ["Structural Insights into Immune Recognition of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus S Protein Receptor Binding Domain - ScienceDirect", "The spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is responsible for host cell attachment and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.

A subset of CoVs uses the cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN), a membrane-bound metalloprotease, as a cell entry receptor. In these viruses, the envelope spike glycoprotein (S) mediates the attachment of the virus particles to APN and subsequent cell entry, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies.

The data provide detailed information on the architecture of the dimeric pAPN ectodomain and its interaction with the CoV S. We show that a protruding receptor-binding edge in the S determines virus-binding specificity for recessed glycan-containing surfaces in the membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain. Comparison of the RBDs of TGEV and PRCV to those of other related CoVs, suggests that the conformation of the S receptor-binding region determines cell entry receptor specificity. Moreover, the receptor-binding edge is a major antigenic determinant in the TGEV envelope S that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies.

Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants.

The majority of the heavy chains belong to a single Ig germline V-gene family, while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences. These analyses demonstrate that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine VH-gene alleles. For instance, one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the VH chains of the neutralizing mAbs, particularly in CDR-1 and CDR-2.

The structure showed that 4C2 recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps the receptor-binding footprint in MERS-RBD, thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and interface-residue competition. 2E6 also blocks receptor binding, and competes with 4C2 for binding to MERS-RBD.

Notably, six of nine bispecific antibodies neutralized B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and the wild-type virus with comparable potency, despite partial or complete loss of activity of at least one parent monoclonal antibody against B.1.351. Furthermore, a bispecific antibody that neutralized B.1.351 protected against SARS-CoV-2 expressing the crucial E484K mutation in the hamster model. Thus, bispecific antibodies represent a promising next-generation countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."], ["Directed evolution of potent neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 using CDR-swapping mutagenesis - ScienceDirect", "There is widespread interest in facile methods for generating potent neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and other affinity proteins against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses to address current and future pandemics. While isolating antibodies from animals and humans are proven approaches, these methods are limited to the affinities, specificities, and functional activities of antibodies generated by the immune system. Here we report a surprisingly simple directed evolution method for generating nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that complementarity-determining region swapping between low-affinity lead nanobodies, which we discovered unintentionally but find is simple to implement systematically, results in matured nanobodies with unusually large increases in affinity. Importantly, the matured nanobodies potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus, and possess drug-like biophysical properties. We expect that our methods will improve in\u00a0vitro nanobody discovery and accelerate the generation of potent neutralizing nanobodies against diverse coronaviruses."], ["Double lock of a potent human therapeutic monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 | National Science Review | Oxford Academic", "Receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion are essential for the establishment of successful infection by SARS-CoV-2. Halting these steps can cure COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse events when administrated with 10 times the effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to the ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the receptor binding domain, possibly interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results suggest that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19."], ["Memory B cell repertoire for recognition of evolving SARS-CoV-2 spike - ScienceDirect", "Memory B cell reserves can generate protective antibodies against repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections, but with unknown reach from original infection to antigenically drifted variants. We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded antibodies from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found seven major antibody competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of antibody-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. Although emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern escaped binding by many members of the groups associated with the most potent neutralizing activity, some antibodies in each of those groups retained affinity\u2014suggesting that otherwise redundant components of a primary immune response are important for durable protection from evolving pathogens. Our results furnish a global atlas of S-specific memory B cell repertoires and illustrate properties driving viral escape and conferring robustness against emerging variants."], ["Identification of potent human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 implications for development of therapeutics and prophylactics | Nature Communications", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that is spreading rapidly, which seriously impacts global public health and economy. Thus, developing effective drugs remains urgent. We identify two potent antibodies, nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with high affinities from a na\u00efve human phage-displayed Fab library. nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 with picomolar and nanomolar IC50 values, respectively. No detectable defects of nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 are found during the preliminary druggability evaluation. nCoVmab1 could reduce viral titer and lung injury when administered prophylactically and therapeutically in human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2)-transgenic mice. Therefore, phage display platform could be efficiently used for rapid development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nmabs) with clinical potential against emerging infectious diseases. In addition, we determinate epitopes in RBD of these antibodies to elucidate the neutralizing mechanism. We also convert nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 to their germline formats for further analysis, which reveals the contribution of somatic hypermutation (SHM) during nCoVmab1 and nCoVmab2 maturation. Our findings not only provide two highly potent nmabs against SARS-CoV-2 as prophylactic and therapeutic candidates, but also give some clues for development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents (e.g., drugs and vaccines) targeting the RBD."], ["Naturally enhanced neutralizing breadth against SARS-CoV-2 one year after infection | Nature", "More than one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease\u00a02019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u00a02 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several working vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies1,2. Here we report on a cohort of 63 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines3,4. In the absence of vaccination, antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable between 6 and 12 months after infection. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response and, as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern similar to or greater than the neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 strain achieved by vaccination of naive individuals2,5,6,7,8. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in the variants of concern4,9. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand markedly after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants."], ["Development of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Specific Monoclonal Antibodies | bioRxiv", "The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive disruptions in every society around the world. To help fight COVID-19, new molecular tools specifically targeting critical components of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is a major component of the viral replication processes, integral to viral particle assembly, and is a major diagnostic marker for infection and immune protection. Currently available antibody reagents targeting the nucleocapsid protein were primarily developed against the related SARS-CoV virus and are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, in this work we developed and characterized a series of new mouse monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies were tested in ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. The variable regions from the heavy and light chains from five select clones were cloned and sequenced, and preliminary epitope mapping of the sequenced clones was performed. Overall, the new antibody reagents described here will be of significant value in the fight against COVID-19."]]
