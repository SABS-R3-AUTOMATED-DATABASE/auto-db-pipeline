To prevent the further spread of the virus, millions of people around the world have been vaccinated for COVID-19. Although the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) has become the gold standard method for determining neutralizing antibodies, this method has many limitations; therefore, there remains an urgent need for a quick and accurate technique to evaluate the immune efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, after the recombinant expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD), we established a colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA) based on the principle of a double antigen sandwich for the detection of total antibodies in sera. Under the developed conditions, the GICA was capable of the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies within 15 min. In addition, the anti-S-RBD antibodies measured by the GICA had a good correlation with the results measured by ELISA, indicating that the GICA may be used as a rapid tool for the detection of neutralizing antibodies derived from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical detection was performed using serum samples obtained from 40 subjects who had received their two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and 20 unvaccinated serum samples. We found that our method had high sensitivity and specificity; therefore, our convenient and rapid GICA method could preliminarily evaluate the protection rate and effectiveness of vaccines by monitoring total antibody levels.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

In contrast with the intensively investigated immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the protein, little is known about the neutralizing antibody binding mechanisms of the N-terminal domain (NTD), let alone the effects of NTD mutations on antibody binding and thereby the risk of immune evasion. Based on 400 ns molecular dynamics simulation for 11 NTD-antibody complexes together with other computational approaches in this study, we investigated critical residues for NTD-antibody binding and their detailed mechanisms. The results show that 36 residues on the NTD including R246, Y144, K147, Y248, L249 and P251 are critically involved in the direct interaction of the NTD with many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), indicating that the viruses harboring these residue mutations may have a high risk of immune evasion. Binding free energy calculations and an interaction mechanism study reveal that R246I, which is present in the Beta (B.1.351/501Y.V2) variant, may have various impacts on current NTD antibodies through abolishing the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction with the antibodies or affecting other interface residues.

Although great efforts have recently been devoted to the interaction of specific antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2, it still remains largely unknown how the other serum proteins affect the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we systematically investigate the interaction of serum proteins with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that non-specific immunoglobulins (Ig) indeed cannot effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD while human serum albumin (HSA) may have some potential in blocking its infection (to ACE2). More importantly, we find that the RBD can cause significant structural changes in Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), by which SARS-CoV-2 may hijack the metabolic pathway of ApoE to facilitate its cell entry.

They, however, are prone to over 5000 mutations on the spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation Tracker based on over 200\u2009000 genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations will impact vaccines and antibodies in development. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of the 462 mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 antibody disrupting mutants is identified, while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that about 65% of the existing RBD mutations, including those variants recently found in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, will strengthen the binding between the S protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in more infectious COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparity between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFE strengthening and weakening of the bindings with antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the human immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery, unfortunately, implies the vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations.

As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, the Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly analyzed the energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the high structural similarity, the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor is estimated to be -16.35 kcal mol-1 stronger than that of SARS-CoV. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (F486, Y505, N501, Y489, Q493, L455, etc.), which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces arise from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found seven mutational sites (K417, L455, A475, G476, E484, Q498 and V503) on SARS-CoV-2 that unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Interestingly, the E484 site is recognized to be the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface, indicating that from the energy point of view, a mutation of E484 would be beneficial to RBD-ACE2 binding. This is in line with recent findings that it is mutated by lysine (E484K mutation) in the rapidly spreading variants of COVID-19 belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. In addition, this mutation is reported to cause virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

However, limited reports have documented the potential negative effects of Fc fusion on vaccine antigens. To determine whether Fc fusion affects the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV antigen, we constructed a Fcassociated MERS-CoV spike protein (eS770-Fc, 110 kDa), whereby human IgG4 Fc domain was fused to MERS-CoV spike protein (eS770) via a Gly/Pro linker using baculovirus as the expression system. For comparative analyses, two eS770 proteins lacking the IgG4 Fc domain were generated using the IdeS protease (eS770-\u0394Fc) or His tag attachment (eS770-His) and the immunogenicity of the above constructs were examined following intramuscular immunization in mice. Contrary to expectations, non-Fc spike proteins (eS770-\u0394Fc, eS770-His; 90 kDa) showed higher immunogenicity than the Fc fusion protein (eS770-Fc). Moreover, unlike non- Fc spike proteins, eS770-Fc immunization did not elicit neutralizing antibodies against MERSCoV. The lower immunogenicity of Fc-fused eS770 was related to alterations in the structural conformation of the spike protein.
